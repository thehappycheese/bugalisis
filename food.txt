               STATEMENT 1: BUDGET OVERVIEW

The 2014-15 Budget marks a major step by the Government to transform the role of
government in people’s lives.
This Budget is about asking all Australians — from households to businesses and
the public sector — to make a contribution today to repair the budget and build a
stronger, more prosperous future for all.
The Budget will redirect taxpayers’ dollars from spending that is consumed today to
productive investment for tomorrow. It will do this while supporting the most
vulnerable, and taking significant steps towards ensuring that government can live
within its means. The decisions in this Budget will move Australia towards equality
of opportunity for all.
The Budget has been set in the context of slightly below trend growth for the
Australian economy and the expectation that unemployment will remain elevated.
Investment in resources projects is still expected to fall and to detract significantly
from growth. Resources exports will rise as completed projects come on line, while
the household sector will strengthen as it responds to low interest rates.
Looking to the longer term, population ageing coupled with falling terms of trade
from historic highs will make it difficult to maintain the growth in living standards
to which Australians are accustomed.
Given this outlook, the Budget balances the need to build our growth potential,
while not placing additional near term pressure on the economy. The Budget
delivers an $11.6 billion Infrastructure Growth Package that will contribute to
$125 billion of additional infrastructure, including incentives to encourage asset
recycling as a catalyst for unlocking significant new infrastructure investment.
When construction projects supported by the Government are completed, they will
add around 1 percentage point to annual GDP.
The Budget also delivers a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund that will
ensure Australia can drive world leading medical research discoveries needed to
underpin the health system of the future, fundamental reforms of the higher
education sector, and measures to support workforce participation.
The underlying cash deficit is projected to be $60 billion over four years to 2017-18,
compared to $123 billion over four years at the 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal
Outlook (MYEFO). This substantial improvement is built off a reduction in average
annual real payments growth from 2.6 percent to 0.8 percent.
By 2017-18 the underlying cash deficit will have fallen to $2.8 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP), and the Government’s finances are projected to be on a clear path to a
credible surplus. Medium-term projections show a surplus of well over one percent
of GDP by 2024-25, even with future tax relief, and with average annual real
payments growth of 2.7 percent, compared to 3.7 percent at MYEFO.
With the changes in this Budget debt would be $389 billion in a decade; $277 billion
lower than the projection of $667 billion at MYEFO, and assuming future tax relief.

                   STATEMENT 1: BUDGET OVERVIEW

INTRODUCTION
In 2014-15 the Australian economy is forecast to grow slightly below trend, with a
large fall in resources investment partly offset by a boost from higher resources exports
and the household sector’s response to low interest rates. The unemployment rate is
forecast to reach 6¼ percent by the June quarter 2015 and remain at this rate to the end
of 2015-16.

The underlying cash deficit in 2014-15 is expected to be $29.8 billion (1.8 percent of
GDP), falling to $2.8 billion in 2017-18 (Table 1).

Without the consolidation outlined here, the budget would have remained in deficit
for at least the next decade — a total of 16 years of deficits — leaving Australia
vulnerable to external shocks, ill-equipped to cope with population ageing, and
increasingly reliant on future generations to pay off our debt. This situation would
have arisen even if Australia achieved a further 10 years of uninterrupted economic
activity — resulting in an unprecedented 33 years of economic growth.

By redirecting spending to more productive ends this Budget has enabled significant
reforms, such as the Asset Recycling Fund, Higher Education deregulation and the
Medical Research Future Fund. Spending growth has been significantly reduced and
the net impact of policy decisions has been to reduce the deficit by $36 billion over the
forward estimates.

The budget is on a clear track to surplus, with a small deficit of $2.8 billion in 2017-18
and a surplus of well over 1 percent of GDP by 2024-25. Commonwealth Government
Securities on issue will fall from the MYEFO estimate of $667 billion in 2023-24 to
$389 billion, assuming future tax relief. The size of Government is projected to fall with
spending as a share of the economy expected to be 24.4 percent in 2023-24, down from
26.5 percent projected in the MYEFO.

Statement 1: Budget Overview


ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
The Australian economy is in the midst of a major transformation, moving from
growth led by investment in resources projects to broader-based drivers of activity in
non-resources sectors. This is occurring at a time when the economy has generally
been growing below its trend rate and the unemployment rate has been rising.

Since MYEFO, the near-term outlook for the household sector has improved. Leading
indicators of dwelling investment are consistent with rising activity, while household
consumption and retail trade outcomes have improved recently, consistent with gains
in household wealth. This is partly offset by weaker business investment intentions,
particularly for non-resources sectors.

The outlook for the resources sector is largely unchanged from MYEFO. Resources
investment is still expected to detract significantly from growth through until at least
2015-16, as reflected in the outlook for investment in engineering construction which is
forecast to decline by 13 percent in 2014-15 and 20½ percent in 2015-16. Rising
resources exports are expected to only partially offset the impact on growth. Overall,
real GDP is forecast to continue growing below trend at 2½ percent in 2014-15, before
accelerating to near-trend growth of 3 percent in 2015-16.

Nominal GDP growth is forecast to remain weak, growing by 3 percent in 2014-15 and
4¾ percent in 2015-16. The weakness of nominal GDP growth reflects the sharp fall in
prices for Australia’s key commodity exports since the start of the year and a further
expected decline in Australia’s terms of trade. Subdued domestic price growth, in the
absence of wage pressures, is also weighing on nominal GDP growth.

The Australian economy is also facing considerable challenges over the
medium- to- longer-term. The decline in Australia’s terms of trade will likely extend
beyond the forecast period, while the rising proportion of older Australians will lead
to lower labour force participation, further constraining per capita income growth.
Confronting these challenges will require faster productivity growth.

This Budget will support stronger and more sustainable economic growth in the
medium term and does not place further pressure on the economy’s transition to
broader-based growth in the near term. Government expenditure is being redirected to
more productive uses, such as expanding infrastructure investment, and the
Government is introducing measures to encourage greater workforce participation. By
getting government finances under control and laying out a credible plan for fiscal
repair, the Government is providing businesses and households with the certainty they
need to invest in their future. This Budget will also help to keep interest rates lower
over time by reducing the public sector’s call on resources, while rebuilding the
Government’s flexibility to respond to adverse shocks in the context of a volatile global
economy.

                                                                       Statement 1: Budget Overview

The outlook for the global economy has improved gradually since the end of 2013, led
by a pickup in activity in advanced economies, most notably the United States. While
activity has moderated in emerging market economies, these economies are still
expected to contribute nearly three quarters of global growth over the forecast period.

There are both upside and downside risks to the economic outlook. Most notably,
non-resources business investment could pick up earlier and more rapidly than
expected following a prolonged period of caution, while some trade-exposed sectors
would benefit from a lower exchange rate, which is historically an outcome associated
with a fall in the terms of trade. Conversely, the fall in resources investment is likely to
be lumpy, while the associated rise in exports also has uncertain timing. International
risks are more balanced than previously, although still to the downside as economies
continue to deal with legacy issues from the financial crisis.

FISCAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The medium-term fiscal strategy of achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the
course of the economic cycle is underpinned by the Government’s objectives to:

    invest in a stronger economy by redirecting Government spending to quality
•
    investment to boost productivity and workforce participation;

    reduce the Government’s share of the economy over time in order to free up
•
    resources for private investment, with payments to GDP falling and paying down
    debt; and

    strengthen the Government’s balance sheet by improving net financial worth over
•
    time.

The 2014-15 Budget repair strategy is designed to deliver budget surpluses building to
at least 1 percent of GDP by 2023-24 with the Government more than offsetting all
new spending measures with decisions to reduce spending elsewhere in the budget.


                                                    1-7
Statement 1: Budget Overview

Any variations in the budget from higher revenue or lower expenses will be banked to
the bottom line rather than spent. The Government’s clear path back to surplus is
underpinned by decisions, rather than an assumption about future policy.

The underlying cash deficit is expected to be $29.8 billion in 2014-15 (1.8 percent of
GDP), compared to a deficit of $33.9 billion projected in MYEFO. The deficit is
expected to fall to $2.8 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2017-18. The underlying cash
balance is expected to reach surplus around the end of the decade, and by 2023-24 the
surplus will reach more than 1 percent of GDP.

Excluding GST, tax receipts are expected to be lower by $2.6 billion in 2013-14 and
$2.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17. Policy decisions since the 2013-14 MYEFO
are expected to increase total receipts by $0.7 billion in 2014-15 and $5.4 billion over the
four years to 2016-17. Abstracting from policy decisions, there has been a small overall
downward revision to total tax receipts (excluding GST) of $2.6 billion in 2013-14 and
$7.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17.

Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, estimated cash payments for 2014-15 have decreased by
$1.2 billion, reflecting decreased payments due to new policy decisions of $1.0 billion
and decreased payments due to parameter and other variations of $0.2 billion.

In 2014-15, net debt for the Australian Government general government sector is
estimated to be $226 billion (13.9 percent of GDP), compared with the 2013-14 MYEFO
estimate of $231 billion (14.2 percent of GDP). By the end of the forward estimates, net
debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to reach 14.0 percent.

Commonwealth Government Securities on issue in 2023-24 are expected to reduce to
$389 billion, even when future tax relief is assumed, compared to the projection of $667
billion in MYEFO before the Government’s actions to repair the budget.


BUDGET STRATEGY AND PRIORITIES
The 2014-15 Budget takes a significant step in transforming the role of government. It
is part of the evolution toward providing equality of opportunity for all Australians.
The Budget redirects taxpayers’ dollars from unaffordable consumption today to
productive investment for the future. It will do this while supporting the most
vulnerable, and beginning the task of ensuring the Government can live within its
means.

The Budget delivers structural reforms that will facilitate growth in living standards
while not placing additional near term pressure on the economy. It will deliver strong
surpluses and lower government debt in the medium term. All Australians are being
asked to contribute to this task — businesses, state and local governments, high
income earners, families, individuals, seniors and workers.



                                            1-8
                                                            Statement 1: Budget Overview

While the Budget is an important step in reforming the size and role of government, it
is not the end of the process. A White Paper on the Reform of Australia’s Tax System
will provide a longer-term considered approach to tax reform that is consistent with
the Government’s core principles of fairness and simplicity.

The Government has also committed to work with the States and Territories on the
development of a White Paper on the Reform of the Federation. The next
Intergenerational Report will examine the fiscal implications of Australia’s longer-term
challenges such as the ageing of the population.


All Australians making a contribution
In this Budget, all Australians have been asked to make a contribution to repairing the
Budget and building a stronger, more prosperous future for everyone.

Temporary Budget Repair Levy
From 1 July 2014 until 30 June 2017, there will be a Temporary Budget Repair Levy of
2 percent on individuals’ taxable income above $180,000. This measure will raise an
estimated $3.1 billion over the forward estimates period. An individual with taxable
income of $300,000 a year will pay an additional $2,400 in tax for each of the next three
years.

More targeted transfer payments
The Government’s reforms to the transfer system are aimed at improving individuals’
ability to participate in the economy. The Government will introduce a number of key
reforms to ensure the long term sustainability of the transfer payments system,
particularly for the aged and families.

The Government’s targeted changes to the Age Pension will not take effect until 2017.
The Government will ensure Age Pension incomes continue to rise through time, in
line with inflation from September 2017.

Eligibility thresholds for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) will be
indexed from September 2014. However, to ensure the sustainability of the CSHC, the
Government will no longer continue with the payment of the Senior Supplement for
Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders from 1 July 2014.

Australians are living longer, healthier lives, with the number of people aged 65 to 84
expected to more than double between 2010 and 2050. Building on the changes of the
previous Government to increase the Age Pension age to 67 by 1 July 2023, the
Government will continue gradually increasing the age pension age to 70 by
1 July 2035.

Family payments will also be reformed, including by tightening eligibility for Family
Tax Benefit Part B (FTB-B). From 1 July 2015 families will no longer receive this



                                          1-9
Statement 1: Budget Overview

payment when their youngest child turns six. In order to give existing recipients time
to adjust the Government has introduced a two-year grandfathering to this change.
Consistent with the Government’s commitment to fairness and supporting the most
vulnerable, a new Family Tax Benefit Part A allowance will be introduced for
low-income sole parents to assist with this change.

The primary income threshold for eligibility for FTB-B will also be reduced from
$150,000 to $100,000 per annum.

Freezing indexation
Indexation of all payment eligibility thresholds will be paused including for family
payments, allowances such as Newstart and parenting payment single, and the Private
Health Insurance Rebate. Payment rates for family payments will also be paused, as
will the indexation of Local Government Financial Assistance Grants and Official
Development Assistance (ODA) and 112 government programmes.

The Government will no longer target an increase of ODA to 0.5 percent of Gross
National Income, with this position to be reconsidered when the budget is in a
stronger position.

Reducing the footprint of government
The public sector will be streamlined to focus on the areas where Commonwealth
Government involvement is necessary.

The Government has an ongoing process that, including Budget measures, has made
decisions to abolish 70 bodies, boards, committees and councils, which will create
greater efficiencies within the public sector and streamline accountabilities. Rigorous
scrutiny of government programmes has seen a reduction in red tape, with 50,000
pages of regulations abolished and more to come.

The Government has previously announced that it will proceed with the sale of
Medibank Private. The Government will conduct reviews into future ownership
options for Australian Hearing, the Defence Housing Authority, the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission Registry function and the Royal Australian
Mint.

Reforming agreements with the States
The Commonwealth does not run schools and public hospital systems and is not
therefore best placed to drive efficiency in these areas. Commonwealth funding
arrangements in these areas have reduced the incentive for States to be more efficient
and accountable for their spending and delivery of services, and were unaffordable.
This Budget reduces growth in Commonwealth funding of these sectors over the
medium-term, generating momentum for longer-term reforms to be considered in the
White Paper on the Reform of the Federation and the White Paper on the Reform of
Australia’s Tax System.

                                                            Statement 1: Budget Overview

The Budget also ceases some ineffective or duplicative Commonwealth payments to
the States. These include National Partnership Agreements for Preventive Health,
Improving Public Hospital Services and Certain Concessions for Pensioners and
Seniors Card Holders.


Building Australia’s future
Infrastructure growth package
The Government is delivering a substantial infrastructure package to support
economic growth and improve the long-term productive capacity of the economy.

The Infrastructure Growth Package will take the Government’s total investment in
transport infrastructure to $50 billion by 2019-20. Total infrastructure investment from
Commonwealth, State and local Governments, as well as the private sector, will build
to over $125 billion of additional infrastructure.

The package includes an Asset Recycling Initiative that will provide financial
incentives to State and Territory Governments to sell existing assets and reinvest the
sale proceeds into additional productive economic infrastructure. This initiative has
the potential to catalyse close to $40 billion of additional investment and contribute to
the creation of a strong pipeline of projects.

In the short- to- medium-term, funding for roads and highways under the Western
Sydney Infrastructure Plan, and new investments under the Infrastructure Investment
Programme, will support the economy as it transitions away from resources led
growth towards broader-based growth in the non-resource sectors.

Additional funds will also be directed to the Black Spots and the Roads to Recovery
Programmes. The National Stronger Regions Fund will allow councils and community
groups to apply for a share of $200 million each year, over five years, towards the cost
of local capital works projects in areas of particular economic stress and community
need.

When the $125 billion of total infrastructure investment is completed, it will add
around 1 percentage point to annual GDP. This includes over $58 billion of additional
infrastructure investment arising from new spending decisions taken in this Budget.

In order to provide a secure and growing source of revenue for Government
investment in road funding, biannual indexation of fuel excise will be re-introduced
from 1 August 2014. This will raise an additional $2.2 billion over the forward
estimates. The additional net revenue will be spent on roads.

Reform of higher education
Higher education has been one of the most successful new export industries to emerge
in the last generation, with education now our fourth largest export earner. However,



                                          1-11
Statement 1: Budget Overview

the sector operates in a highly competitive and globalised market, where overseas
universities are rapidly building their quality and global reputation.

Full deregulation of the higher education sector will be achieved by removing fee caps
and expanding the demand-driven system to bachelor and sub-bachelor courses at all
higher education providers. Higher education institutions will be responsible for the
setting of course fees.

This change will allow Australian universities to continue to compete with the best in
the world by giving them the freedom to innovate, a greater ability to invest in world
class research, and the capacity to respond to the needs of students and businesses in
terms of choice and quality.

Students will benefit through more accessible higher education supported by the
continuation of the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) and more courses and
institutions receiving Commonwealth support. Higher education providers will be
required to direct 20 percent of additional revenue from increases in new student
contributions to a scholarship scheme which will support access for disadvantaged
students. To support the sustainability of higher education funding, the
Commonwealth’s contribution towards a new student’s course fees will be reduced by
20 percent on average and indexed at CPI. For students enrolled on or before
13 May 2014, existing arrangements will be grandfathered and remain in place until
the end of 2020.

The Government will also support those learning a trade by providing concessional
Trade Support Loans of up to $20,000 over a four year apprenticeship, from
1 July 2014. These loans will assist with the cost of undertaking an apprenticeship, and
help them focus on completing a formal trade qualification.

Sustainable and improved health care
The Government is introducing a number of measures which ensure that health
spending growth is on a sustainable path.

Savings from health expenditure in this Budget will be redirected towards the
establishment of a new capital protected Medical Research Future Fund (the Fund) (see
Box 1). Savings will accumulate through time until the balance of the fund reaches
$20 billion, which is projected to be in 2019-20, and will make this fund the largest of
its kind in the world.

When mature, the Fund will provide a flow of income to double current medical
research funding, with an additional $1 billion a year available by 2022-23 to find the
discoveries and cures necessary to underpin the health system of the future.

The Fund will help ensure Australia can continue to advance world leading medical
research projects, attract and retain first class researchers and deliver improved health
outcomes for all Australians. It will also ensure that the Government can maintain its


                                          1-12
                                                             Statement 1: Budget Overview

existing level of health investment, while delivering a sustainable health system into
the future.

Government savings initiatives in this Budget include the introduction of patient
contributions towards the costs of standard GP visits and for imaging and pathology
services and a new Medicare Safety Net. The Government is also increasing
co-payments for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines to ensure the
scheme remains sustainable into the future. The PBS safety net will protect those most
in need and those who need numerous medicines. The Government will also gradually
increase eligibility thresholds for the PBS safety net over the next four years for all
patients.

 Box 1: Medical Research Future Fund

 The Government is meeting its commitment on health by investing every dollar
 from health savings in this Budget into the Medical Research Future Fund (the
 Fund), until the Fund reaches $20 billion. To achieve this, without delaying prudent
 changes to improve the sustainability of the health system, the Government is
 establishing the Fund from 1 January 2015, subject to the passage of health savings
 legislation. The uncommitted funds in the existing Health and Hospitals Fund will
 be transferred into the Fund at its inception. The Fund’s capital is set to be preserved
 in perpetuity, while net earnings from the Fund will be distributed to support
 medical research, including through the National Health and Medical Research
 Council.

Supporting workforce participation
The Government is encouraging young Australians to either learn or earn by requiring
jobseekers up to 30 years of age applying for Newstart or Youth Allowance (Other) to
participate in job search and employment service activities for up to an additional
six months before receiving any payment. The six-month waiting period will be
reduced for those who have already been working for significant periods. At any time
while unemployed, jobseekers are able to choose to undertake further study and are
able to apply for Youth Allowance (Student) or AUSTUDY.

Building on our election commitment, the Government is also providing scope for
around 32,000 mature-aged job seekers each year to re-enter the work force through
the Restart programme. This programme provides a wage subsidy of up to $10,000 to
employers who hire an eligible mature-aged job seeker on a full-time basis, with this
payment being pro-rated for those who are employed on a part-time basis.

The Government will also proceed with a comprehensive Paid Parental Leave
scheme — this scheme will encourage and assist women to be able to have a family
and remain connected to the workforce.




                                          1-13
Statement 1: Budget Overview

Facilitating innovation and competitiveness
Business welfare stifles innovation and competitiveness. The Budget continues the
evolution towards programmes that facilitate innovation and self-reliance, by reducing
and reshaping existing industry assistance programmes into a new Entrepreneurs’
Infrastructure Programme that will focus on supporting commercialisation of good
ideas, job creation and lifting the capability of small business.

New free trade agreements with Korea and Japan will provide new opportunities for
both Australian exporters and consumers. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement
gives Australian exporters significantly improved market access, including to the
Korean beef market and to legal, accounting, telecommunications, education and
financial services.

The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement also provides improved market
access, with more than 97 percent of Australia’s exports to receive preferential access.

Protecting Australia
Protecting the nation is the first responsibility of government. The Government is
taking decisive steps to recapitalise Defence after a number of years of
underinvestment and deferred funding for major capability projects. In this Budget the
Government will bring forward $1.5 billion in spending from 2017-18 to earlier years,
and re-invest any efficiencies back into Defence capability.

By implementing Operation Sovereign Borders, the Government has taken strong and
immediate action to restore integrity to Australia’s borders and stop the boats. This is
in contrast to a peak of over 4,000 arrivals in July 2013.

Investment in efficient and effective border management will continue to underpin
Australia’s national security and future economic prosperity. Australia’s border
protection services will also be consolidated into a single frontline border agency —
the Australian Border Force — to enforce our customs and immigration laws and protect
our borders.

              STATEMENT 2: ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

OVERVIEW
The Australian economy is in the midst of a major transformation, moving from
growth led by investment in resources projects to broader-based drivers of activity in
the non-resources sectors. This is occurring at a time when the economy has generally
been growing below its trend rate and the unemployment rate has been rising. During
this transition, the economy is expected to continue to grow slightly below trend and
the unemployment rate is expected to rise further to 6¼ percent by mid-2015.

In this environment, the Government is focused on implementing measures to support
growth and jobs while putting in place lasting structural reforms to restore the nation’s
finances to a sustainable footing. The timing and composition of the new policy
decisions mean that the faster pace of consolidation in this Budget does not have a
material impact on economic growth over the forecast period, relative to the 2013-14
Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO).

Since MYEFO, the near-term outlook for the household sector has improved. Leading
indicators of dwelling investment are consistent with rising activity, while household
consumption and retail trade outcomes have improved recently, consistent with gains
in household wealth. This is partly offset by weaker business investment intentions,
particularly for non-resources sectors.

The outlook for the resources sector is largely unchanged from MYEFO. Resources
investment is still expected to detract significantly from growth through until at least
2015-16, as reflected in the outlook for investment in engineering construction which is
forecast to decline by 13 percent in 2014-15 and 20½ percent in 2015-16. Rising
resources exports are only expected to partially offset the impact on growth. Overall,
real GDP is forecast to continue growing below trend at 2½ percent in 2014-15, before
accelerating to near-trend growth of 3 percent in 2015-16.

The labour market has been subdued since late 2011, characterised by weak
employment growth, a falling participation rate and a rising unemployment rate,
although outcomes since the beginning of 2014 have been more positive. The
unemployment rate is forecast to continue to edge higher, settling around 6¼ percent,
consistent with the outlook for real GDP growth. Consumer price inflation is expected
to remain well contained, with moderate wage pressures and the removal of the
carbon tax.

The outlook for the global economy has improved gradually since the end of 2013, led
by a pickup in activity in advanced economies, most notably the United States. While
activity has moderated in emerging market economies, these economies are still
expected to contribute nearly three quarters of global growth over the forecast period.


                                          2-3
Statement 2: Economic Outlook

Despite continued solid growth in China, prices for Australia’s key commodity exports
have fallen sharply since the start of the year. Coal prices are expected to remain weak
while iron ore prices are expected to ease further in line with growing world supply. In
light of a further expected decline in the terms of trade and subdued domestic price
growth, nominal GDP is forecast to remain historically weak, growing by only
3 percent in 2014-15 before strengthening somewhat to 4¾ percent in 2015-16.

Sustained softness in nominal GDP growth is a recent phenomenon, emerging over the
past two years. Given the importance of nominal GDP to income growth, this
continuing weakness contributes to ongoing subdued growth in a number of major
areas of revenue.

There are both upside and downside risks to the economic outlook. Most notably,
non-resources business investment could pick up earlier and more rapidly than
expected following a prolonged period of caution, while some trade-exposed sectors
would benefit from a lower exchange rate, which is historically an outcome associated
with a fall in the terms of trade. Conversely, the fall in resources investment is likely to
be lumpy, while the associated rise in exports also has uncertain timing. International
risks are more balanced than previously, though still to the downside as economies
continue to deal with legacy issues from the financial crisis.

There is always a degree of uncertainty around the forecasts, which can be estimated
based on past errors. Appendix B of Statement 3 provides further detail. The degree of
uncertainty is also reflected in the divergent views outside government. The Budget
forecasts are within the range of non-government forecasts. Appendix B provides
further detail. Appendix A analyses the performance of Treasury’s 2012-13 forecasts in
retrospect.

Statement 2: Economic Outlook


OUTLOOK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY
The global economic outlook has improved gradually since the end of 2013, led by a
pickup in activity in advanced economies. Over the same period, activity has
moderated in emerging market economies, although they are still expected to
contribute nearly three quarters of global growth over the forecast period, with growth
in China remaining solid. The risks are more balanced than previously, though still to
the downside. Both advanced and emerging market economies are continuing to deal
with legacy issues from the financial crisis. These include adjusting to a tightening of
financial conditions as the United States gradually normalises its unconventional
monetary policy, and addressing continued high unemployment in many advanced
economies.

In 2013, the global economy experienced its most subdued pace of growth since the
financial crisis, expanding by around 3 percent. World GDP growth is expected to
gradually pick up towards trend across the forward estimates with growth of
3½ percent in 2014, and 3¾ percent in both 2015 and 2016, largely reflecting growing
momentum in the recoveries of advanced economies. With diverging conditions across
advanced and emerging market economies, a stronger global economy is not expected
to be reflected in evenly robust growth across regions and countries.

Forecast growth for Australia’s major trading partners has improved slightly to
4¾ percent over the forecast period, above its trend rate of around 4 percent. This
reflects both the improved outlook in advanced economies and the increasing weight
accorded to Australia’s fast growing Asian partners.

While growth in China has moderated, it is still expected to remain solid. The
economy grew 7.7 percent in 2013, slightly above the official target of 7.5 percent.

                                                          Statement 2: Economic Outlook

Consistent with the recent softening in key indicators, growth is expected to moderate
to 7¼ percent in 2014 and 7 percent by 2016, as the economy adjusts to the inevitable
slowdown from the very high rates of credit growth in recent years, and becomes less
dependent on investment and more on consumption.

The United States is poised for stronger economic growth over the year ahead, with
forecasts of above trend growth. Relatively weak data in early 2014 is expected to
reflect the impact of an unusually severe winter and lower inventory levels after
significant stockpiling in late 2013. Household consumption has underpinned the
recovery to date, with a long-awaited pickup in business investment expected to
provide ongoing momentum. Fiscal headwinds from 2013 have also abated, as has
short-term fiscal uncertainty with the latest budget deal and suspension of the debt
ceiling. The United States Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue to reduce
asset purchases as conditions strengthen. However, while inflation remains subdued, a
tightening of policy (through official interest rate increases) is not expected
before 2015.

In Japan, the economy has been boosted by short-term monetary and fiscal stimulus
and a pickup in private demand and prices. Growth is forecast to moderate in the
aftermath of the consumption tax hike in April this year, though partially offset by
fiscal stimulus. The recovery is forecast to remain relatively subdued given a range of
structural constraints on growth — such as a falling working age population and
relatively low female labour force participation — and continued fiscal consolidation.
A stronger recovery in Japan requires the ‘third arrow’ of structural reforms to lift
productivity and longer-run growth potential, and the successful achievement of the
Bank of Japan’s inflation objectives.

Despite the welcome pickup in activity in the euro area, the recovery is forecast to
remain weak, uneven and fragile. Euro area GDP growth is expected to strengthen to
around 1 percent supported by accommodative monetary policy, an easing of fiscal
headwinds, improved external demand and a more even balance of risks. However,
the outlook remains subdued, given continued financial system impairment, an ageing
population and the effect of structural rigidities on productivity and employment
growth. A more enduring resolution to the euro area design will require challenging
reforms, including establishing an effective banking union.

Major ASEAN economies moderated in 2013 on the back of tighter financial
conditions, lower commodity prices and structural impediments to growth. However,
domestic demand remains resilient and, for the more trade-exposed economies, an
improved global outlook should also support relatively solid growth. India is showing
early signs of recovery from a consumption and investment-led slowdown, although
its structural impediments are expected to constrain growth to around 5 to 6 percent.

Statement 2: Economic Outlook


OUTLOOK FOR THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY

Key influences affecting the outlook
The Australian economy is going through an extraordinary period of transition, with
investment in resources projects shifting from being the key driver of growth towards
becoming a significant detractor from growth. The fall in investment, which is
expected to happen alongside a further decline in the terms of trade, will lead to a
reversal of the substantial shift of labour and capital into the resources sector that has
taken place since the beginning of the investment phase.

These influences on the Australian economy are expected to persist for some time. The
substantial decline in resources investment is forecast to continue through until at least
2015-16, while the decline in the terms of trade will likely last longer still. Further
complicating the growth outlook is the need to pursue a prudent approach to
Australia’s fiscal situation over the years ahead in order to help manage the impact of
the ageing population and build the capacity to respond to future global shocks.

That said, the economy is forecast to grow only slightly below trend (Chart 1). The
household sector is responding to historically low interest rates and wage flexibility is
supporting employment growth. The fall in the exchange rate over 2013 is also
helping, although further falls would help support the necessary rebalancing of the
economy.

Household sector responding to low interest rates
There are clear signs that the household sector is responding to low interest rates.
Dwelling sector indicators uniformly point to a pickup in activity, suggesting
construction will gain momentum in the near term (Charts 2 and 3), while household
consumption is being boosted by recent improvements in wealth. These developments
have contributed to an improved outlook for the household sector at a time when
household income is being restrained by the soft labour market.

The housing sector is beginning to respond to lower interest rates with a pickup in
prices and leading indicators of construction. Rising dwelling prices in mid-2013 were
one of the first signs that the dwelling sector was responding to low interest rates,
while leading indicators of dwelling construction began to rise around the same time
as the sector responded to the improved returns available from building.

Dwelling investment is yet to reflect the strength in leading indicators, growing by
only 1.4 percent through the year to the December quarter 2013. Liaison suggests this
sluggish response is most likely due to the increasing proportion of approvals in
medium- and high-density dwellings, which are more complex projects to manage and
take longer to plan and complete. This suggests dwelling investment should rise
strongly over the near term.

Dwelling investment is forecast to grow by 7½ percent in 2014-15 and 5½ percent in
2015-16.

The increase in dwelling prices since mid-2013 has coincided with higher equity prices
and generated an 11 percent rise in household wealth over the year to the
December quarter 2013. Rising wealth has encouraged consumption to grow more

Statement 2: Economic Outlook

rapidly than household income, with the (trend) household saving ratio falling from a
peak in 2012 near 12 percent to its current level of around 10 percent.

Household income is expected to grow more slowly than average over the forecast
period, reflecting moderate employment growth and subdued wage growth. However,
further gains in household wealth are expected to support a further modest decline in
the saving ratio, enabling consumption to grow faster than income.

Notwithstanding this anticipated decline, the saving ratio is expected to remain well
above the levels seen in the decade before the financial crisis, which were a reflection
of a prolonged period of rising household borrowings. After the crisis, households
reduced their demand and appetite for credit, leading to a sharp step-up in the
household saving ratio and a marked slowing in household credit growth.
Developments in household consumption will be heavily influenced by how these
factors change during the prospective period of moderate income growth.

Household consumption is forecast to grow by 3 percent in 2014-15 and 3¼ percent
in 2015-16.


The resources boom transitioning between phases
Investment in resources projects has passed its peak and is expected to detract
significantly from growth over the next three years (Charts 4 and 5). While there is
some confidence about the size of the decline in resources investment, the precise
timing of the fall remains less certain. The size of the fall is more predictable because of
the small number of large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects that are underpinning
the current resources investment profile, and the construction lead time associated
with, and the small number and size of, any other projects that might be undertaken in
the near term.

Non-resources businesses are waiting before investing
Investment by non-resources businesses remains subdued. While interest rates remain
low and business confidence is higher than it was a year ago, conditions remain
difficult, as reflected in low levels of capacity utilisation and business surveys. Not
surprisingly, given these circumstances, the latest CAPEX data point to only a modest
increase in investment in 2014-15. This is consistent with reports from Treasury’s
business liaison which suggests firms are reluctant to invest until they have a clearer
sense that demand is improving.

The scale and timing of the anticipated recovery in non-resources business investment
is the predominant source of uncertainty affecting the outlook. Consistent with the
CAPEX data, the outlook for 2014-15 remains subdued, with growth likely again to be
below trend. However, there are some positive signs including a rise in approvals for
non-residential building over 2013. Non-resources investment is forecast to pick up in
2015-16 as firms start to respond to improving demand and existing levels of spare
capacity are absorbed, with GDP growth returning towards trend (Chart 5).

Overall new private business investment is forecast to fall by 5½ percent in 2014-15
and 3½ percent in 2015-16. The fall in resources investment is reflected in the forecast
for new engineering construction, which is expected to fall by 13 percent in 2014-15
and 20½ percent in 2015-16. The recovery in non-resources investment has influenced
the forecast for new non-residential building investment, which is expected to remain
flat in 2014-15 and grow by 5 percent in 2015-16, and the forecast for new machinery
and equipment investment, which is expected to fall by 2 percent in 2014-15 and grow
by 7 percent in 2015-16.

Resources exports continue to grow
The strong rise in resources exports over recent years is expected to continue over the
forecast period as capacity in the resources sector continues to come on stream. The
volume of non-rural commodity exports is forecast to grow by 8 percent in 2014-15
and 9½ percent in 2015-16.

Large expansions in iron ore infrastructure are mainly complete and production will
build up to designed capacity over the next two years. Coal export volumes are also
expected to rise, although both metallurgical and thermal coal producers are under
pressure from low prices and higher costs which saw Australian producers move from
predominantly the bottom half of the global cost curve to the top half over the past
five years. Impediments to driving down costs will exacerbate the pressure associated
with weak prices and could result in mine closures and job losses.

To date, coal mine closures have been limited, with many producers bound by
contractual arrangements with infrastructure providers that require some payment for
transport regardless of the volume of coal actually transported. Under these
arrangements, many producers are maximising their production to reduce average


                                                2-12
                                                           Statement 2: Economic Outlook

unit costs. This situation raises uncertainty around the outlook for coal exports,
particularly if price weakness continues and as contracts with infrastructure providers
expire.

Exports of LNG are expected to grow significantly by 2015-16 as the more advanced
LNG projects begin production. By 2015-16, the value of LNG exports is expected to be
roughly double its current level. This would see it surpass both thermal and
metallurgical coal, currently Australia’s second and third largest exports by value.
Continued robust growth is also expected beyond the forecast years as additional
projects come online, with Australia likely to overtake Qatar to become the world’s
largest LNG exporter before the end of the decade.

While these projects are already in the construction phase, considerable uncertainty
remains over exactly when they will begin exporting, and how quickly they can ramp
up to full capacity. A number of projects have already experienced cost overruns and
have delayed expected start-up dates. The unique properties of individual gas fields
and technological differences between conventional and unconventional gas extraction
will also likely affect gas flow rates and the ability to reach the project’s stated
capacity.

Projects that fail to meet their production targets may need to purchase gas from
established gas sources, either in Australia or overseas, to meet contractual obligations
to foreign customers. Shortfalls are most likely to occur on the East Coast gas network,
which will have implications for domestic gas users in the form of higher prices and
more difficulty in securing long-term supply agreements. Restrictions on the spread of
new gas extraction technologies are likely to make this problem more acute.

Notwithstanding significant drought in Queensland, New South Wales and parts of
South Australia and Victoria, rural exports are forecast to decline only marginally in
2014-15. Exports are expected to recover in 2015-16, assuming a return to average
seasonal conditions.

The depreciation of the exchange rate over 2013 has created better conditions for
exporters, but the exchange rate remains high by historical standards. This strength
stands in sharp contrast to the historical tendency of the exchange rate to move
together with the terms of trade. Exporters will benefit from the improved outlook for
growth in our major trading partners. The already lower exchange rate is likely to
support modest growth in non-commodity goods exports, which are forecast to rise by
3 percent in 2014-15 and 3½ percent in 2015-16. Services exports improved over
2012-13, ending a period of weakness that began around the financial crisis, buoyed by
higher tourism arrivals, particularly from China and South-East Asia, a trend that is
expected to continue. Services exports are forecast to grow by 3 percent in both
2014-15 and 2015-16.

Total exports are forecast to increase by 5½ percent in 2014-15 and 7 percent in
2015-16.

Statement 2: Economic Outlook

Over the forecast period, imports of capital goods are expected to decline as
construction on LNG projects winds down. Imports of consumption goods are forecast
to grow reflecting near trend consumption growth and the elevated exchange rate, but
at more moderate rates than the average of the previous decade. Total imports are
forecast to grow by 2 percent in 2014-15 and 2½ percent in 2015-16.


The terms of trade are expected to continue to decline
After holding up during the second half of 2013, iron ore and coal prices have fallen
sharply since the beginning of 2014. The decline has been due to weaker demand for
steel, a period of negative sentiment around China’s economic growth prospects, as
well as rising global supply, in particular due to recently built capacity coming on line
from Australia.

Iron ore prices are expected to fall further in 2014-15 and 2015-16, reflecting further
growth in global supply and slower growth in demand for steel. Metallurgical coal
prices are expected to rise slightly over the forecast period as global supply growth
slows, while thermal coal prices are forecast to remain stable (Charts 6 and 7).

LNG export prices are expected to increase over the forecast period as the new
contracts associated with projects that are starting up come into force. As most LNG
contract prices are tied to global oil prices, there is some uncertainty over future price
movements. Global supply developments, particularly the potential for gas exports
from the United States, will also have important implications for global gas prices.
While this is unlikely to have a large impact on current LNG projects, which have
long-term contractual arrangements, additional US supply to the Asia-Pacific region
would affect the feasibility of new or expanded operations in Australia.


                                                             2-14

Over the longer term, it is also possible that LNG exports from the US may be directed
across the Atlantic, given a renewed focus on energy security in Europe following
events in Ukraine. This would reduce potential supply in the Asia-Pacific and could
support prices in the region.

The weak outlook for commodity export prices is consistent with the medium-term
projections based on a bottom-up framework outlined in MYEFO as described in
Treasury Working Paper 2014-01,1 which sees a falling terms of trade until 2019-20.
The terms of trade are expected to fall by 6¾ percent in 2014-15 and 1¾ percent in
2015-16 (Chart 8).

The current account deficit is forecast to widen from 3¼ percent of GDP in 2013-14 to
4 percent of GDP in 2014-15, before narrowing slightly to 3¾ percent of GDP in
2015-16, driven mainly by changes in the trade balance.

While export volumes will rise, further expected weakness in export prices implies that
the trade balance is likely to return to a modest deficit over the forecast horizon.
Further, as the economy transitions from the investment to the exports phase of the
mining boom, Australia’s net income deficit is expected to widen due to the high
degree of foreign ownership in Australia’s resources sector.

Statement 2: Economic Outlook

Fiscal consolidation continuing
The measures in this Budget improve the budget bottom line over the forecast period
and beyond. Over the forecast period, the timing and composition of the new policy
decisions mean that the faster pace of consolidation in this Budget does not have a
material impact on economic growth relative to the 2013-14 MYEFO, including because
the fiscal multipliers associated with infrastructure spending are larger than those for
the measures having a direct impact on households and businesses. Fiscal
consolidation, at both Commonwealth and State levels, is one of the forces acting on
the economy taken into account in the setting of interest rates by the Reserve Bank of
Australia.

Public final demand, which captures the direct economic impact of public sector
consumption and investment by all levels of government, is forecast to grow
moderately, as governments pursue budget consolidation. New public final demand
is forecast to grow by 1½ percent in 2014-15 and by 1 percent in 2015-16. These
forecasts represent a significantly smaller than average contribution to overall growth
from public demand.

Incentives provided through the $5 billion Asset Recycling Initiative by the
Commonwealth Government for state governments to reinvest the proceeds of
privatisations into new productivity-enhancing infrastructure, along with $3.7 billion
of additional investment for road projects and the $2.9 billion Western Sydney
Infrastructure Plan, are expected to boost construction activity from 2015-16. This will
enable states to employ construction capacity that will be freed up as investment in the
resources sector winds down. Governments can also fund projects beyond the finance
generated by privatisation and Commonwealth assistance.

Investment in national infrastructure adds immediately to economic activity and can
also lift the long-term potential output of the economy, particularly by allowing
businesses to expand to exploit the better transport, communications or energy
solutions available.


Weakness in the labour market leading to subdued wages
Participation in the labour market can be affected by structural and cyclical factors.
The change in the population’s age structure as the `baby boomers’ reach retirement
age is exerting downward pressure on participation. The downward pressure is due to
the increasing proportion of the population in older age groups that have low
participation. At present, this pressure is being predominately offset by other
structural factors not related to ageing, including increases in the participation rate for
many specific age groups, particularly over 60s. However, the negative structural
effect due to ageing is expected to start dominating by the end of the decade.

The fall in the participation rate over the past three years has been driven not only by
ageing but also by potential employees giving up the search for work, given weak

employment demand and scarce job opportunities. This phenomenon, the discouraged
worker effect, is associated with a cyclical downturn in the labour market and is
consistent with sub-trend demand across the economy.

That said, there has been a significant pickup in employment growth and job vacancies
have improved since the start of the year. While the turnaround is encouraging, there
remains significant spare capacity in the labour market. In trend terms, the
employment to population ratio continues to decline, and the unemployment rate
would be markedly above its current rate of 5.8 percent if the participation rate had
not fallen significantly over the past three years.

Over the forecast period, the participation rate is expected to decline from its current
rate of 64.7 percent to 64½ percent in the June quarters of both 2015 and 2016,
reflecting the expectation that employment growth will not be strong enough to entice
discouraged workers to resume their job search (Chart 9). However, an improvement
in job vacancies and advertisements in early 2014 indicates that there are upside risks.

A number of measures in the 2014-15 Budget support participation and economic
growth: the Restart initiative for over-50s; the tightened unemployment benefit
arrangements for under-30s; changes to eligibility for Family Tax Benefit Part B; and
the Paid Parental Leave scheme.

Statement 2: Economic Outlook

Employment growth is forecast to be 1½ percent through the year to the June quarters
of both 2015 and 2016 reflecting sub-trend GDP growth across the economy. This
forecast is on an aggregate basis and employment will vary across industry sectors.
Based on the employment and participation rate forecasts, the unemployment rate is
forecast to be 6¼ percent in the June quarters of both 2015 and 2016 (Chart 10),
although positive labour market developments since the start of the year suggest the
unemployment rate could peak at a lower level.

Recent wage growth has been very subdued, consistent with the current spare capacity
in the labour market. The wage price index grew by 2.6 percent through the year to
the December quarter 2013, its weakest growth since the series began in 1997.

Wage flexibility is an important adjustment mechanism. As was seen during the
financial crisis, slower wage growth allows employers to maintain higher staff levels,
particularly at a time when business income is expected to come under pressure from
the declining terms of trade. It will also encourage non-resources sectors to employ
more of the labour that will be freed up as major resources projects are completed.

Subdued wage growth is expected to continue until the spare capacity in the labour
market is absorbed. The wage price index is forecast to grow by a still subdued
3 percent through the year to the June quarters of both 2015 and 2016.

Consumer price inflation is forecast to remain contained over the forecast period.
Subdued wage growth will help keep unit labour costs down and contribute to lower
inflationary pressure. The removal of the carbon tax is expected to reduce the headline
Consumer Price Index (CPI) by ¾ of a percentage point and the underlying CPI by
¼ of a percentage point over the year to the June quarter of 2015 compared to what it

would have been with a $25.40 carbon tax. Headline inflation is forecast to be
2¼ percent through the year to the June quarter of 2015 and 2½ percent to the
June quarter of 2016. Underlying inflation is forecast to be 2¼ percent through the
year to the June quarter of 2015 and 2½ percent to the June quarter of 2016.


Outlook for nominal GDP remains weak
Nominal GDP growth is expected to remain well below its 20-year average over the
forecast period, largely reflecting further declines in the terms of trade and subdued
domestic price growth.

Below average nominal GDP growth is generating weak income growth over the
forecast period. This is reflected in weak growth in company gross operating surplus,
corresponding to low output prices, and weak growth in compensation of employees,
corresponding to low wage growth. Nominal GDP is forecast to grow by 3 percent in
2014-15 and 4¾ percent in 2015-16 (Chart 11).

Risks
International risks are more balanced than previously, although still to the downside.
Advanced and emerging market economies continue to deal with legacy issues from
the financial crisis. Ongoing financial fragilities remain and the search for yield may
see new risks emerge in some markets. The process of normalising US monetary policy
may cause financial market volatility and may trigger a reassessment of some
emerging market economies with pre-existing domestic vulnerabilities.




                                               2-19
Statement 2: Economic Outlook

New risks include the resurfacing of geopolitical tensions, which may also affect
vulnerable emerging market economies, and are not without the potential for wider
implications.

Another emergent risk to the outlook for the euro area is the persistence of very low
inflation outcomes, which may cause inflation expectations to drift down and raise the
possibility of area-wide deflation. This risk adds another layer of complexity for
policymakers in managing an already weak and uneven recovery. Other risks include
the lingering weaknesses in the financial system, the handling of the asset quality
review of euro area banks, concerns with budget sustainability, and the ongoing
official assistance to some member countries.

In China, there are downside risks around managing both the economy’s financial
sector — including shadow banking activities and high rates of leverage in some
sectors — and the reform initiatives to help rebalance the economy and move up the
production chain.

In the United States, there is a risk that recent weak data could reflect more than just
temporary or weather-related factors. In the other direction, with many of the factors
holding back the recovery having abated, US growth could be stronger than expected.
Japan will need to balance the needs of its recovery with charting a path towards
budget consolidation over the medium-term. The effective implementation of
structural reforms to boost Japan’s growth potential presents an upside risk to the
medium-term outlook.

Domestic risks are evenly balanced. The household sector is clearly responding to low
interest rates. Although business investment intentions remain weak, a further
improvement in domestic or external demand could provide the necessary incentive
for firms to upgrade their plans. Non-resources exports have been subdued for an
extended period under the influence of the strong exchange rate. A weaker exchange
rate, which is historically an outcome associated with a declining terms of trade, would
benefit exporters and import-competing sectors in general and result in a better
balance between the exchange rate and the level of interest rates than is currently the
case.

Balancing these upside risks, the fall in resources investment is likely to be lumpy,
while the associated rise in exports also has uncertain timing. Together, these effects
could generate short-term weakness in GDP. Many trade-exposed sectors continue to
battle against a still-elevated exchange rate, while a further softening of the labour
market would have repercussions for household consumption. Finally, while a further
large increase in house prices would support economic activity in the near term, it
would also raise concerns about whether prices could be sustained at that level and
whether policy might need to respond.

                                                         Statement 2: Economic Outlook


MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS
The budget forward estimates contain economic forecasts for the budget year and the
subsequent financial year, and projections for the next two financial years. These
projections are not forecasts, but rather are based on a set of medium-term
assumptions.

In previous Budgets, and MYEFOs prior to 2013-14, real GDP was projected to grow at
its estimated trend rate, and the unemployment rate was assumed to immediately
return to 5 percent, Treasury’s estimate of the non-accelerating inflation rate of
unemployment (NAIRU). In times when the degree of spare capacity in the economy
was small, and the unemployment rate was close to the NAIRU, this approach had
significant merit.

However, as flagged at MYEFO and subsequently, these medium-term assumptions
have been revisited to consider whether they remain appropriate in the face of a large
and rising level of spare capacity in the economy. In the 2013 PEFO, an alternative
assumption of above trend growth and gradually declining unemployment was
presented for the projection years, recognising that the economy would be operating
with spare capacity by the end of the forecast period. In the 2013-14 MYEFO, real GDP
in the two projection years was assumed to grow at its trend rate, and unemployment
was maintained at its rate at the end of the forecast period, 6¼ percent. If this
approach had been maintained over the years beyond the forward estimates, it would
have been akin to assuming the spare capacity was permanent — meaning real GDP
would never return to trend levels and unemployment would remain permanently
above the NAIRU.

Based on current forecasts, by the end of 2015-16, the economy will have grown slower
than trend for seven of the past eight years. As a result, it is estimated that the
economy will be operating at that time with a gap between potential output and actual
output of about 2 percent (Chart 12) — the largest such output gap since the
mid-1990s.

Building on the revised assumptions made in MYEFO, Treasury has reviewed the
projection methodology with the aim of incorporating a path of adjustment that closes
this gap over the medium term. The 2014-15 Budget adopts a new framework, which
assumes that the spare capacity is absorbed over the five years following the two-year
forecast period. This new framework is laid out in Treasury Working Paper 2014-02.3

Under this framework, real GDP returns to its trend level by 2020-21. As this occurs,
labour market variables, including employment and the participation rate, converge
from their levels at the end of the forecast period to their long-run trend levels.

With spare capacity at the end of the forecast period, real GDP is projected to grow
above trend for a period of five years from 2016-17. Real GDP growth over this period
is therefore stronger than projected at MYEFO.

However, the level of output remains below potential over these years, resulting in
projected wage growth that is weaker than at MYEFO. The extended period of
below-trend wage growth helps to facilitate sufficient employment growth to
transition unemployment gradually back to the NAIRU. In turn, weaker wage costs
are projected to flow through to subdued prices growth, with correspondingly slower
growth in the GDP deflator, and hence in nominal GDP.

Over the projection period, as a result of the revised methodology nominal GDP is
higher, with stronger real GDP growth only partially offset by a lower GDP deflator,
the number of unemployment benefit recipients is lower and growth in wage-indexed

payments is slower. Compared with MYEFO, the revised projection methodology
results in a reduction in the underlying cash balance of $0.3 billion (0.02 percent of
GDP) in 2016-17 and an increase of $0.9 billion (0.05 percent of GDP) in 2017-18. By
2024-25, the new methodology increases the underlying cash balance by $3.4 billion
(0.12 percent of GDP).

Statement 2: Economic Outlook


           APPENDIX A: MACROECONOMIC FORECASTING
                                  PERFORMANCE

The Government’s macroeconomic forecasts are prepared using a range of modelling
techniques, including structural macroeconometric models and equations, spreadsheet
analyses and accounting frameworks. These are supplemented by survey data,
business liaison, expert opinion and judgement.

In 2012, the Secretary to the Treasury commissioned an independently-overseen
Review of Treasury Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting.4

The Review concluded that the forecasts draw upon ‘the full range of information and
modelling techniques used by comparable agencies overseas’, and place broadly
appropriate weight on the various tools available to forecasters. The Review made
11 recommendations on how to improve forecasting performance, all of which are
being implemented. This appendix responds to Recommendation 5:

        Treasury should include in the Budget papers a high level review of the economic
        forecast errors (nominal and real GDP) for the previous financial year, as a
        complement to the existing discussion of revenue forecasting errors.

Macroeconomic forecasts are always subject to a margin of error. 5 Charts A.1 and A.2
show the magnitude of the Budget year forecast errors for real and nominal GDP
growth over the past 20 years. The independent review concluded that, over the
20 years to 2011-12, Treasury’s forecasts of real GDP growth exhibited little evidence of
bias, with accuracy generally remaining within a range of ½ to 1 percentage point.
While forecasts of real GDP growth were less accurate in years during and
immediately after the financial crisis, forecast errors have since returned to that range.
The Budget year forecast error for nominal GDP in 2012-13 was larger than its
20-year average.


2012-13 real and nominal GDP growth forecasts
Economic forecasts for 2012-13 were first published in the 2011-12 Budget. Subsequent
forecasts were published in the 2011-12 MYEFO, 2012-13 Budget, 2012-13 MYEFO and
2013-14 Budget.

In 2012-13, Australia recorded another year of below-trend economic growth, with
activity remaining patchy across certain sectors of the economy. Despite continued
strength in resources investment, subdued activity in the household sector and
non-resources business sectors weighed on growth. Households continued to exercise
caution as income growth slowed and non-resources businesses remained reluctant to

Statement 2: Economic Outlook

invest in the face of subdued profit growth and poor trading conditions. New public
final demand also contracted for the first time since 1993-94, reflecting efforts to
consolidate fiscal balances at the Commonwealth and state levels. Below-trend growth
saw the unemployment rate start to rise, while inflation remained in the bottom half of
the RBA’s target band.

Chart A.3 presents the evolution of Treasury’s forecasts for 2012-13 real GDP growth.
The absolute percentage errors for forecasts of 2012-13 real GDP growth were largest
in the 2011-12 Budget (at 1.2 percentage points) and smallest in the 2012-13 MYEFO
and 2013-14 Budget (at 0.4 percentage points), while the 2012-13 Budget absolute
percentage error was 0.7 percentage points.6 Over the past 20 years, Treasury’s mean
absolute percentage error for the Budget forecast of real GDP growth in the budget
year has been 0.8 percentage points.

The main contributors to the GDP forecast errors were business investment and
household consumption. Business investment in 2012-13 was overestimated as both
resources and non-resources firms repeatedly scaled back investment plans, while
household consumption was subdued by much weaker than expected wage growth.

In 2012-13, nominal GDP grew by 2.5 percent — the weakest growth since the early
1990s recession — with large falls in bulk commodity export prices contributing to a
9.8 percent fall in the terms of trade and compensation of employees growing at its

    the distance between the forecast percentage growth rate and the outcome. All other things
    equal, a smaller number indicates a better forecasting performance.

weakest rate since 1991-92. Chart A.4 presents the evolution of Treasury’s forecasts for
2012-13 nominal GDP growth.

The absolute percentage error in the forecast of 2012-13 nominal GDP growth was
largest in the 2011-12 Budget (at 3.3 percentage points) and smallest in the
2013-14 Budget (at 0.8 percentage points), while the 2012-13 Budget absolute
percentage error was 2.5 percentage points. Over the past 20 years, Treasury’s mean
absolute percentage error for the budget forecast of nominal GDP growth in the
budget year has been 1.4 percentage points.

The largest absolute forecast error in the components of nominal GDP growth was in
the terms of trade, with a smaller forecast error recorded in domestic prices and real
GDP growth. The forecast error for the terms of trade was largest for export prices,
reflecting the difficulty of forecasting commodity prices during periods of substantial
price volatility. The forecast error for domestic price growth reflected a smaller than
expected increase in business investment prices, with cost overruns reported by
resources companies not flowing through into higher investment prices as expected,
and weaker consumer price inflation, which was muted by a higher than expected
unemployment rate.

   APPENDIX B: COMPARISON WITH CONSENSUS FORECASTS
Consensus Economics collect forecasts on key macroeconomic variables from a
number of prominent economists. The mean and range of these forecasts provide
benchmarks with which to compare the Government’s economic forecasts. Forecasts
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provide a benchmark from an
international institution.

IMF and Consensus forecasts are provided on a calendar year basis. The 2014-15
Budget forecast for real GDP growth in calendar year 2014 is lower than the Consensus
Economics mean forecast and broadly in line with the IMF’s forecast (Chart B.1). The
Budget forecast for calendar year 2015 is broadly in line with the Consensus Economics
mean forecast and higher than the IMF’s forecast (Chart B.2).

   STATEMENT 3: FISCAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK

This Budget is the Government’s first major step towards meeting our election
commitment to repair the Budget.
The Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses, on
average, over the course of the economic cycle. The fiscal strategy underlines the
commitment to budget discipline and outlines how the Government will set
medium-term fiscal policy while allowing for flexibility in response to changing
economic conditions. To deliver on this medium-term fiscal strategy over time, the
Government will repair the Budget by ensuring new spending is more than offset by
reduced spending, and positive variations in receipts and payments from favourable
economic conditions are banked as improvements to the budget bottom-line.
The deficits inherited from the former Government over the four years to 2016-17
totalled $123 billion at the 2013-14 MYEFO. In the Government’s first four years to
2017-18, deficits are estimated to total just $60 billion — an improvement of
$43.8 billion over these four years compared with the 2013-14 MYEFO. This
improvement will be achieved by decisions that reduce wasteful spending, improve
the sustainability of our social safety net, encourage greater personal responsibility
and encourage the states to take greater responsibility for their hospitals and
schools. Of the decisions taken in this Budget, 77 percent of the improvement to the
bottom line is the result of reductions to spending. The Government is redirecting
spending from consumption to investments that will drive economic growth.
In the 2014-15 Budget, the Government is budgeting for an underlying cash deficit
of $29.8 billion (1.8 percent of GDP) in 2014-15, improving to a deficit of $2.8 billion
(0.2 percent of GDP) in 2017-18. The pace of fiscal consolidation balances the need
for structural fiscal repair with the shorter term impact on the economy.
The Budget also deals with the significant real growth in payments inherited from
the former Government in 2017-18, where payments were previously growing at
5.9 percent above inflation between 2016-17 and 2017-18. As a result of the actions
in the Budget, the Government has reduced this real growth in payments to
2.6 percent. The improvement to the budget bottom line in 2017-18 is $25.6 billion,
$20.3 billion is the result of decisions to cut spending.
The structural savings we have put in place reduce the spiralling of payments
growth and drive a significantly more sustainable budget position in the medium
term. Based on the economy continuing to grow, the medium-term projections
indicate a return to surplus by the end of the decade.
At the 2013-14 MYEFO, Commonwealth Government Securities on issue were
projected to reach $667 billion in 2023-24. This is projected to reduce to $326 billion
in this Budget assuming no tax relief. With a tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 percent,
Commonwealth Government Securities on issue in 2023-24 would still reduce to
$389 billion compared to $748 billion if a tax cut had been in place at MYEFO.

      STATEMENT 3: FISCAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK

OVERVIEW
The 2014-15 Budget reins in wasteful spending, improves the sustainability of our
social safety net and encourages greater personal responsibility. The Government is
asking all Australians to make a contribution to repair the budget and refocus
government spending on those areas of the economy that will drive economic growth
and safeguard our future prosperity. This Budget delivers medium-term structural
budget reform by ensuring government spending is on a manageable trajectory,
providing a credible path to a projected surplus and ensuring Australia’s
medium-term fiscal sustainability.

The deficits inherited from the former Government that were outlined in the
2013-14 MYEFO for the four years to 2016-17 totalled $123 billion. In our first four
years to 2017-18, deficits are estimated to total just $60 billion — an improvement of
$43.8 billion over these four years compared with the 2013-14 MYEFO. Savings
decisions begin to have an impact from 2014-15 where government spending is
redirected from recurrent expenditure to productive investments in infrastructure. A
significant contribution to this improvement in the bottom line is in 2017-18 where a
$25.6 billion improvement to the deficit includes hard decisions taken to deliver
$20.3 billion of savings from payments. These decisions are needed to ensure the
sustainability of the budget position in the medium term, reducing the average real
growth in payments to 2.7 percent from an unsustainable 3.7 percent at the 2013-14
MYEFO. Current medium-term projections indicate a return to surplus by the end of
the decade. There is however, much work still to be done to improve on that position.

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

The Government is budgeting for an underlying cash deficit of $29.8 billion
(1.8 percent of GDP) in 2014-15, improving to a deficit of $2.8 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP) in 2017-18 as shown in Table 1.

The Government’s actions will also strengthen the Commonwealth’s balance sheet by
stabilising and then reducing debt. This will recharge the fiscal buffers to ensure we
are able to respond to future economic challenges. The face value of Commonwealth
Government Securities on issue is expected to fall from $667 billion in 2023-24 as
outlined in the 2013-14 MYEFO to $389 billion, even with the Budget projection (unlike
the MYEFO projection) building in future tax relief through an assumed tax cap of
23.9 percent of GDP. 1

Net financial worth is estimated to be -$329.2 billion (-20.2 percent of GDP) in 2014-15
and is expected to stabilise at around -$352.7 billion (-18.7 percent of GDP) in 2017-18.


FISCAL STRATEGY

The Government’s fiscal strategy
In this Budget, the Government outlines its fiscal strategy, consistent with the
requirements of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (See Box 1).




1   This is the average tax-to-GDP ratio of the years following the introduction of the GST and
    prior to the global financial crisis (from 2000-01 to 2007-08 inclusive).

                                                 Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook


Box 1: The Government’s fiscal strategy

Medium-term fiscal strategy
The Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses, on
average, over the course of the economic cycle.

Our strategy is underpinned by the following three policy elements:

    investing in a stronger economy by redirecting Government spending to quality
•
    investment to boost productivity and workforce participation;

    maintaining strong fiscal discipline to reduce the Government’s share of the
•
    economy over time in order to free up resources for private investment to drive
    jobs and economic growth, with:
         the payments-to-GDP ratio falling;
    –
         paying down debt by stabilising and then reducing Commonwealth
    –
         Government Securities on issue over time; and

    strengthening the Government’s balance sheet by improving net financial worth
•
    over time.

Budget repair strategy
The Budget repair strategy is designed to deliver budget surpluses building to at
least 1 percent of GDP by 2023-24 consistent with the medium-term fiscal strategy.

Our strategy sets out that:

    new spending measures will be more than offset by reductions in spending
•
    elsewhere within the budget;

    the overall impact of shifts in receipts and payments due to changes in the
•
    economy will be banked as an improvement to the budget bottom line, if this
    impact is positive; and

    a clear path back to surplus is underpinned by decisions that build over time.
•

The Budget repair strategy will stay in place until a strong surplus is achieved and
so long as economic growth prospects are sound and unemployment remains low.




                                         3-7
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

Delivering on the medium-term fiscal strategy
In the 2014-15 Budget, the Government has put the Budget on a far more sustainable
footing consistent with the medium-term fiscal strategy.

Budget surpluses over the course of the economic cycle
This Budget enables the Government to deliver a substantial reduction of $43.8 billion
in the underlying cash deficit since the 2013-14 MYEFO over the four years to 2017-18.
The deficits at the 2013-14 MYEFO for the four years to 2017-18 totalled $104.1 billion,
using the medium-term projection for 2017-18 of a deficit of $28.4 billion. The deficits
over the same period in the 2014-15 Budget total $60.2 billion.

The headline annual pace of consolidation is 0.7 percent of GDP over the forward
estimates. Abstracting from the one-off nature of the Reserve Bank of Australia
transaction, the pace of consolidation is 0.6 percent of GDP. This pace of consolidation
over the forward estimates strikes the right balance between the impact of fiscal
consolidation on the economy and sustainable structural reforms.

Beyond the forward estimates the savings measures in this Budget are expected to
grow, contributing to a substantial improvement in the fiscal position.

Chart 2 shows the projected underlying cash balance under two scenarios. The no tax
cap scenario allows the average tax rates to increase above the long-term average. If
fiscal drag, including income tax bracket creep, is allowed to occur indefinitely then a
rising personal income tax burden would also have negative impacts on workforce
participation. This potential reduction in GDP growth has not been taken into account.

The tax cap scenario assumes that taxes are not allowed to grow beyond the average of
23.9 percent of GDP.

In the tax cap scenario, the budget is projected to be at balance in 2018-19, and in a
strong surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2024-25, delivering on the election
commitment for surpluses to build to at least 1 percent of GDP by 2023-24.

These projections are based on a further 10 years of uninterrupted economic growth.
Such an outcome would take our record to 34 consecutive years of growth by 2024-25,
a record unparalleled amongst advanced economies.

These projections do not assume a cap on real spending growth to achieve budget
surpluses. Instead, the substantial improvement to the bottom line is built on a
significant reduction in payments growth as a result of the Government’s long-term
budget savings.

In the tax cap scenario, average annual real payments growth over the medium term
(the period from 2018-19 to 2024-25) falls to 2.7 percent, compared to 3.7 percent
projected at the 2013-14 MYEFO. The payments-to-GDP ratio declines from
25.3 percent of GDP in 2014-15 to 24.2 percent in 2024-25, falling below the long-term
average2 as shown in Chart 3.

Total payments in the no tax cap scenario are lower than in the tax cap scenario
because additional tax receipts reduce the issuance requirement for Commonwealth
Government Securities and thereby lower public debt interest payments.




2    The long-term average payments-to-GDP ratio is 24.9 percent of GDP, calculated over a
     30 year period from 1983-84 to 2012-13.

A key element of the fiscal strategy is investing in a stronger economy by redirecting
government spending to quality investments to boost productivity and participation.

To drive the productivity required to generate economic growth, the Government has
refocused spending on infrastructure and reforms to higher education.

The Infrastructure Growth Package will provide additional infrastructure spending of
$11.6 billion to address critical transport bottlenecks. This investment will take the
Government’s total investment in transport infrastructure to $50 billion by 2019-20.
Total infrastructure investment from Commonwealth, State and local governments, as
well as the private sector, will build to over $125 billion of additional infrastructure.

The Infrastructure Growth Package is designed to support economic growth in the
short term and the economy’s longer term productive capacity.

Strong fiscal discipline
The Government’s fiscal strategy reflects a commitment to maintain the strong fiscal
discipline required to pay down debt. This is a necessary part of reducing the
Government’s share of the economy over time in order to free up resources for private
investment to drive jobs and economic growth, and live within our means.
The Government has begun the task of reducing the payments-to-GDP ratio which
falls from 25.3 percent of GDP in 2014-15 to 24.7 percent of GDP in 2016-17, before
returning to 24.8 percent of GDP in 2017-18.
The Government recognises that this is only the first step in repairing the Budget and
that there is further work to do.

The slight rise in the payments-to-GDP ratio in 2017-18 occurs despite the
Government’s decisions that reduce government spending by $15.5 billion. The real
growth in payments inherited in 2017-18 was 5.9 percent. Without action, the growth
in payments in 2017-18 would have been $38.0 billion, payments-to-GDP in 2017-18
would have been 25.9 percent of GDP, and would have resulted in a deficit of
$28.4 billion. The Government’s decisions have reduced this real growth to 2.6 percent
and a deficit of $2.8 billion.
By 2024-25, the payments-to-GDP ratio is projected to reduce to 24.2 percent of GDP.
This is below the long term average of 24.9 percent of GDP. A falling
payments-to-GDP ratio will mean that the Government will be better placed to lower
taxes.
The Government will achieve fiscal consolidation through medium-term structural
savings to the budget. These savings decisions will help to improve the sustainability
and efficiency of Government spending. The largest savings beyond the forward
estimates are through:

    changes to welfare payments for young people with full working capacity;
•

    changes to the funding of the Official Development Assistance programme;
•

    reforms to hospital funding and health expenditure, including new patient
•
    contributions to the costs of medical services;

    reforms to schools funding to drive efficient delivery of education services;
•

Strengthening the Government’s balance sheet
Improving net financial worth over time, and stabilising and then reducing
government debt will generate a stronger Commonwealth balance sheet and help to
ensure ongoing fiscal sustainability. Returning the budget to surplus is a key part of
achieving this outcome.

A strong balance sheet provides the Government the flexibility to respond to
unanticipated events during times of financial crises or economic shocks. It can also
provide flexibility in facilitating economic reform, address shortfalls in infrastructure
investment and respond to structural changes in the economy, such as the ageing
population.

Strengthening the Government’s balance sheet means that government debt is kept at
manageable levels, which reduces the interest cost burden. This has the benefit of more
stable tax and spending policies and ensures future generations do not have to bear the
burden of restoring weak finances.

Some key aggregates that provide indications of fiscal sustainability are net financial
worth, net debt, net worth, and net interest payments set out in Table 2. Net financial
worth is the primary indicator of fiscal sustainability articulated in the medium-term
fiscal strategy. It provides a broader measure of the Government’s assets and liabilities



                                                                      3-14

that the Future Fund is intended to offset.

(a) Net financial worth equals total financial assets minus total liabilities.
(b) Net debt equals the sum of deposits held, government securities, loans and other borrowing, minus the sum of
    cash and deposits, advances paid and investments, loans and placements.


Net financial worth is estimated to be -$329.2 billion (-20.2 percent of GDP) in 2014-15,
$6.0 billion worse than estimated at the 2013-14 MYEFO.

This deterioration reflects a downward revaluation of superannuation liabilities, and a
fall in the value of the Government’s investments in public sector entities. These
negative impacts are partially offset by the higher value of investments held by the
Government in newly established funds and other deposits. In 2016-17, net financial
worth is projected to improve by $10.4 billion since the 2013-14 MYEFO. By 2017-18, it
is projected to start stabilising at around -$352.7 billion. Net financial worth improves
as a share of GDP, falling from -20.2 percent of GDP in 2014-15 to -18.7 percent of
GDP in 2017-18.

Net worth is expected to be -$212.0 billion in 2014-15, $5.0 billion worse than estimated
at the 2013-14 MYEFO. Net worth is expected to be -$227.4 billion by the end of the
forward estimates.

Net debt is estimated to be $226.4 billion in 2014-15 (13.9 percent of GDP). As the
definition of net debt does not include superannuation liabilities or equity investments
(which drive the fall in net financial worth), net debt has improved by $4.7 billion in
2014-15 compared to the 2013-14 MYEFO. Net debt is expected to be $264.2 billion by
the end of the forward estimates.

In the medium term under the tax cap scenario, net debt is projected to decline to
0.7 percent of GDP in 2024-25 as shown in Chart 8. Given the fall in

The Government is determined to reduce the impact that servicing debt has on the
budget. In the tax cap scenario, net interest payments are expected to peak at
$13.1 billion in 2018-19 and decline to $6.6 billion in 2024-25 (0.2 percent of GDP) as
shown in Chart 9. In 2023-24, net interest payments would reduce from the
2013-14 MYEFO projection of $31.5 billion to $8.3 billion in this Budget. This is a
reduction in net interest costs of $23.2 billion. With a AAA credit rating, Australia faces
a relatively low cost of borrowing.

Delivering on the budget repair strategy
The 2014-15 Budget drives the budget repair strategy that is designed to deliver budget
surpluses building to at least 1 percent of GDP by 2023-24.

All new decisions taken in this Budget have been more than fully offset, contributing
to a clear path back to surplus. The Government has not used estimates variations
from increased receipts or decreased payments to fund new spending.

The net budget impact of policy decisions is a $36.0 billion improvement to the
underlying cash balance over the forward estimates to 2017-18. Over the same period,
net increases in receipts from policy decisions have improved the underlying cash
balance by $8.3 billion, while net savings from payments have improved the
underlying cash balance by $27.7 billion. Of the decisions taken in this Budget,
77 percent of the improvement to the bottom line is the result of reductions to
spending.

As a result of decisions, receipts have increased by $8.9 billion over the forward
estimates period to 2017-18, offset by decreases in receipts of $0.6 billion. Increases in
receipts are as a result of decisions taken to repair the budget by introducing a
temporary levy on individuals’ incomes above $180,000 and removing poorly targeted


                                                                              3-17

tax concessions. In addition, receipts are increased by the reintroduction of the
indexation of fuel excise rates which will be used to fund roads.

The Government has made $47.7 billion in savings from payments in this Budget over
the forward estimates to 2017-18, to pay for new spending of $20.0 billion. The impact
of these savings decisions builds over time, reducing payments growth, consistent
with the policy to repair the Budget.

Real growth in payments is estimated to be -1.7 percent in 2014-15, 0.4 percent in
2015-16, 2.1 percent in 2016-17 and 2.6 percent in 2017-18. Over the four years to
2017-18, the average real growth in payments in the 2014-15 Budget of 0.8 percent
more than halves the average at the 2013-14 MYEFO of 1.9 percent.

In the 2017-18 year, the Government has taken significant decisions to address
increasing program costs, with savings from payments totalling $20.3 billion. This has
reduced real payments growth between 2016-17 and 2017-18 from 5.9 percent at the
2013-14 MYEFO to 2.6 percent in this Budget. These structural savings decisions build

Underlying cash balance estimates
The estimated underlying cash deficit in 2014-15 has improved by $4.1 billion, to
$29.8 billion compared to the 2013-14 MYEFO.

As outlined in the 2013-14 MYEFO the deficits inherited from the former Government
from the four years to 2016-17 totalled $122.6 billion. In the Government’s first
four years to 2017-18, deficits are estimated to total $60.2 billion.

The change in the estimated underlying cash balance since the 2013-14 MYEFO is
largely a result of major policy decisions, saving the bottom line $17.6 billion over the
four years to 2016-17. As a result of decisions, the Government has improved the
bottom line by a further $18.5 billion in 2017-18.

Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, parameter and other variations have worsened the bottom
line by $2.2 billion in the four years to 2016-17. There have also been changes made to
the projection methodology used to formulate projections for economic parameters
factored into the budget. Further information on this change is detailed in Statement 2:
Economic Outlook. Over the projection period, as a result of the revised methodology


                                                     3-20

nominal GDP is higher, with stronger real GDP growth only partially offset by a lower
GDP deflator, the number of unemployment benefit recipients is lower and growth in
wage-indexed payments is slower. Compared with the 2013-14 MYEFO, the revised
projection methodology results in a reduction in the underlying cash balance of
$0.3 billion (0.02 percent of GDP) in 2016-17 and an increase of $0.9 billion
(0.05 percent of GDP) in 2017-18. By 2024-25, the new methodology increases the
underlying cash balance by $3.4 billion (0.12 percent of GDP).

Policy decisions
Policy decisions since the 2013-14 MYEFO are expected to increase receipts by
$673 million in 2014-15, $1.9 billion in 2015-16, $2.8 billion in 2016-17 and $2.9 billion in
2017-18. These decisions include: reintroducing the indexation of fuel excise,
introducing a temporary levy on individuals’ incomes above $180,000 and removing
poorly targeted tax concessions.

Significant measures include:

    Reintroducing the indexation of fuel excise rates. From 1 August 2014, fuel excise
•
    and fuel excise-equivalent customs duty will be indexed biannually in line with the
    consumer price index. This is expected to increase receipts by $4.2 billion over the
    forward estimates period, however taking into account the corresponding
    payments increases, such as to fuel tax credits, the net increase in the underlying
    cash balance is $2.3 billion.




                                            3-22
                                                  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

    The introduction of a Temporary Budget Repair Levy. From 1 July 2014 until
•
    30 June 2017, there will be a temporary levy of two percent on individuals’ taxable
    income above $180,000. This measure is expected to increase receipts by $3.1 billion
    over the forward estimates period.

    The Mature Age Workers Tax Offset and the Dependent Spouse Tax Offset will
•
    both be abolished from 1 July 2014. Removing these tax concessions that are no
    longer well targeted, is expected to increase receipts by $1.1 billion over the
    forward estimates period.

Parameter and other variations
While the forecast for nominal GDP is similar to the 2013-14 MYEFO, estimated
changes to the components of growth have affected the composition of tax receipts.
Stronger than expected company profits and household consumption have resulted in
upward revisions to company tax and GST, while weaker than expected wage growth
has contributed to the write-down to taxes from individuals and superannuation
funds.

This has resulted in a small overall downward revision to total tax receipts of
$1.8 billion in 2013-14 and $2.9 billion over the four years to 2016-17 compared with the
2013-14 MYEFO. Excluding GST, tax receipts are expected to be lower by $2.6 billion in
2013-14 and $7.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17.

Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, non-tax receipts have increased by $1.3 billion in 2014-15
and $4.8 billion over the four years to 2016-17. The increase in 2014-15 primarily
reflects higher forecasts of expected dividend and interest receipts ($479 million). In
addition, recognition of State and Territory contributions to the National Disability
Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for the first time has increased non-tax receipts by
$176 million in 2014-15 ($3.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17). These State and
Territory contributions are directly offset by a corresponding increase in payments to
NDIS recipients.

Analysis of the sensitivity of the receipts estimates to changes in the economic outlook
is provided in Appendix A to this Statement.

Payment estimates
Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, total cash payments for 2014-15 have decreased by
$1.2 billion, comprised of new policy decisions which have decreased payments by
$1.0 billion and parameter and other variations which have decreased payments by
$167 million.

Policy decisions
The net impact of policy decisions since the 2013-14 MYEFO is expected to decrease
payments by $1.0 billion in 2014-15, $4.0 billion in 2015-16, $7.6 billion in 2016-17 and
$15.5 billion in 2017-18. These decisions include:


                                          3-23
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

    establishing the Asset Recycling Initiative, which will provide State and Territory
•
    governments with incentive payments to unlock capital from state-owned assets
    and reinvest the proceeds in new productivity-enhancing economic infrastructure.
    The Initiative is expected to increase cash payments by $335 million in 2014-15
    ($5.0 billion over the five years to 2018-19);

    funding for new infrastructure investments, under the Infrastructure Investment
•
    Programme to support economic growth, which is expected to increase cash
    payments by $202 million in 2014-15 ($3.7 billion over the five years to 2017-18).
    Funding will be provided to States and Territories to expedite existing large
    infrastructure projects and new high productivity infrastructure projects
    ($2.9 billion), and to boost funding for the existing Black Spot Programme
    ($200 million), Roads to Recovery Programme ($350 million), and the National
    Highway Upgrade Programme ($229 million);

    delivering a Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, by funding major road projects
•
    for the development of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek and providing
    the transport infrastructure necessary to support a growing population in Western
    Sydney. This Plan is expected to increase cash payments by $103 million in 2014-15
    ($2.9 billion over the ten years to 2023-24);

    establishing the Emissions Reduction Fund from 1 July 2014, which will provide an
•
    incentive based approach to support abatement activities across the economy to
    contribute to Australia meeting its target of reducing emissions by 5 percent below
    year 2000 levels by the year 2020. This measure is expected to increase cash
    payments by $75 million in 2014-15 ($2.6 billion over the ten years to 2023-24); and

    strengthening incentives for mature age job seekers to re-enter the workforce with
•
    the creation of a new wage subsidy — Restart — which is expected to increase cash
    payments by $18 million in 2014-15 ($304 million over the four years to 2017-18). A
    payment of up to $10,000 will be available to employers who hire a mature age job
    seeker aged 50 years or over. The $221 million over four years for a seniors
    employment incentive payment, previously announced at the 2013-14 MYEFO, will
    also be redirected to the Restart Programme.

The impact of these policy decisions on payments has been more than offset over the
five years to 2017-18 by a number of decisions that have reduced cash payments,
including:

    maintaining official development assistance (ODA) at its nominal 2013-14 level of
•
    $5 billion in both 2014-15 and 2015-16 and growing it in line with the consumer
    price index from 2016-17. This measure is expected to decrease cash payments by
    $559 million in 2014-15 ($7.9 billion over the five years to 2017-18, which includes
    $2.0 billion in 2017-18 from extinguishing a provision for new ODA spending);

                                                    Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

    reducing Medicare Benefits Schedule rebates by $5 for general practitioner
•
    consultations and out-of-hospital pathology and diagnostic imaging services and
    allowing the providers of these services to collect a $7 patient contribution, which is
    expected to reduce cash payments by $3.4 billion over the five years to 2017-18.
    These savings will be reinvested in the Medical Research Future Fund, which will
    be established on 1 January 2015;

    maintaining current Family Tax Benefit (FTB) payment rates in nominal terms for
•
    two years from 1 July 2014, which is expected to reduce cash payments by
    $377 million in 2014-15 ($2.6 billion over the four years to 2017-18);

    limiting eligibility for the FTB Part B to families whose youngest child is younger
•
    than six years of age from 1 July 2015, with transitional arrangements for two years,
    which is expected to increase cash payments by $17 million in 2014-15 but reduce
    cash payments by $1.6 billion over the five years to 2017-18; and

    changing access to income support arrangements for people under 30 years of age,
•
    to encourage young people with full work capacity to be earning, learning or
    participating in Work for the Dole. This is expected to reduce cash payments by
    $221 million in 2014-15 ($1.2 billion over the four years to 2017-18).

Further details of Government policy decisions are provided in Budget Paper No. 2,
Budget Measures 2014-15. The expense estimates provided in Budget Paper No. 2 are in
accrual terms and may not align with the payment figures provided in this Statement.

Parameter and other variations
This Budget also incorporates some major changes in expected payments in 2014-15 as
a result of parameter and other variations since the 2013-14 MYEFO. Major increases
include:

    Disability Support Pension payments, which are expected to be $325 million higher
•
    in 2014-15 ($962 million over the four years to 2016-17), largely reflecting higher
    than expected average payment rates and marginally higher than expected
    customer numbers;

    Private Health Insurance Rebate payments, which are expected to be $300 million
•
    higher in 2014-15 ($1.2 billion over the four years to 2016-17), largely reflecting
    stronger than expected growth in the number of people with subsidised private
    health cover and more people upgrading their level of health insurance;

    Child Care Fee Assistance payments, which are expected to be $298 million higher
•
    in 2014-15 ($1.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17), largely reflecting higher than
    expected utilisation of child care services;

    Payments under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which are
•
    expected to be $244 million higher in 2014-15 (although a reduction in payments of


                                           3-25
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

    $96 million is expected over the four years to 2016-17). This primarily relates to an
    expected delay in disaster recovery payments to Queensland, which largely reflects
    a delay in the completion of reconstruction works as a result of drought;

    Defence payments, mainly in relation to capital purchases, which are expected to be
•
    $186 million higher in 2014-15 ($436 million over the four years to 2016-17) as a
    result of foreign exchange rate movements; and

    National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) payments, which are expected to be
•
    $176 million higher in 2014-15 ($3.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17), reflecting
    the recognition of payments made on behalf of the States and Territories for the first
    time. This increase in payments is directly offset by an increase in non-tax receipts
    reflecting State and Territory contributions to the Scheme.

Major reductions in expected payments in 2014-15 as a result of parameter and other
variations since MYEFO, include:

    Illegal Maritime Arrival management costs, which are expected to be $309 million
•
    lower in 2014-15 ($1.6 billion over the four years to 2016-17), reflecting the impact of
    reduced forecasts and projections of the numbers of Illegal Maritime Arrivals;

    Income Support for Seniors payments, which are expected to be $307 million lower
•
    in 2014-15 ($2.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17), reflecting lower than
    expected customer numbers and average payment rates, related to the incremental
    increase in the Age Pension age and an improvement in the value of financial assets
    held by part–rate pensioners;

    Payments under the National Health Reform Agreement, which are expected to be
•
    $243 million lower in 2014-15 ($1.0 billion over the four years to 2016-17), due to a
    lower than expected rate of hospital utilisation and slower than expected growth in
    the price of hospital services;

    Payments under the National Rental Affordability Scheme which are expected to be
•
    $121 million lower in 2014-15 ($312 million over the four years to 2016-17),
    reflecting a lower than anticipated number of dwellings delivered through the
    National Rental Affordability Scheme; and

    Fuel Tax Credit payments, which are expected to be $119 million lower in 2014-15
•
    ($140 million over the four years to 2016-17), reflecting lower than expected usage
    of fuels which are eligible for the payments.

Consistent with previous budgets, the underlying cash balance has been improved by
the regular draw down of the conservative bias allowance. Details of this draw down
are provided in the Other Purposes section of Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital
Investment.

Fiscal balance estimates
The fiscal deficit is expected to be $25.9 billion (1.6 percent of GDP) in 2014-15, which
reflects an improvement of $5.6 billion compared to the 2013-14 MYEFO.

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook

Revenue estimates
Changes in accrual revenue are generally driven by the same factors as cash receipts,
though differences arise where revenue raised in a given year is not received in that
year.

Expense and net capital investment estimates
Movements in accrual estimates and net capital investment over the forward estimates
are broadly similar to the movements in cash payments. The key exceptions include:

    an increase in the accrued superannuation expenses for civilian and military
•
    superannuation schemes of $3.5 billion, where there are differences between the
    timing of cash payments and accrued expenses;

    a decrease in Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) expenses of $2.1 billion,
•
    where the value of the concessionality of the loans has reduced as a result of
    changing the indexation applied to HELP debts from 1 June 2016; and

    an increase in expenses of $756 million in relation to the concessional loan the
•
    Government will provide to accelerate the delivery of the WestConnex Stage 2
    project.

Detailed information on expenses and net capital investment can be found in
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment.


Headline cash balance estimates
The headline cash balance consists of the underlying cash balance, net cash flows from
investments in financial assets for policy purposes (for example, the equity funding of
NBN Co), and net Future Fund earnings.

Table 7 provides further detail between the underlying and headline cash balance
estimates of the Australian Government general government sector.

The headline cash balance for 2014-15 is estimated to be a deficit of $33.5 billion
(2.1 percent of GDP), compared with a deficit of $42.4 billion at 2013-14 MYEFO
(2.6 percent of GDP). Over the four years to 2017-18, the headline cash deficit
improves by $22.1 billion, from $33.5 billion in 2014-15 to $11.4 billion in 2017-18.

The improvement in the headline cash balance is primarily driven by policy decisions
that have affected the underlying cash balance. From 2015-16, this improvement from
policy decisions has been partially offset by changes to the Higher Education Loan
Program and bringing forward some NBN Co equity funding to within the forward
estimates.


Structural budget balance estimates
The outlook for the structural budget balance has improved significantly since the
2013-14 MYEFO, in line with the improvement in the outlook for the underlying cash
balance. The structural position of the budget is forecast to improve to around balance
by 2018-19 and is projected to be in surplus beyond that. By comparison, at the 2013-14
MYEFO the budget was expected to remain in structural deficit throughout the entire
medium-term projections period. Following a prolonged period of significant
structural deficits, the policy decisions taken by the Government are projected to
restore the budget to a position that is structurally sustainable in the medium term.

trade, and using the forecast average from 2003-04 to 2015-16 (upper bound). The central estimate is based
on the structural level of the terms of trade in the Government’s medium-term economic projections. The
methodology for producing the structural budget balance estimates was detailed in Treasury Working Paper

Structural budget balance measures are sensitive to the assumptions and parameters
underpinning the estimates, including identifying the structural level of the terms of
trade and the relationship between tax receipts and economic activity. Due to the
sensitivity of estimates to assumptions, it is best to consider a range of structural
budget balance estimates based on plausible assumptions for the underlying
parameters as one element of a broader assessment of fiscal sustainability.




3   The structural budget balance estimates shown in Chart 11 incorporate the changes to the medium-term
    economic projections framework detailed in Budget Statement 2 and Treasury Working Papers 2014-01
    and 2014-02. Because structural budget balance calculations are sensitive to estimates of the output gap,
    these methodological changes have resulted in revisions to the structural budget balance estimates. The
    peak impact is in 2015-16, when the structural budget deficit is projected to be 0.8 percentage points
    smaller than would have been the case had the previous medium-term projections framework been
    retained. The impact becomes smaller as the estimated output gap closes, falling to 0.5 percentage points
    in 2018-19 and close to zero by 2022-23. These impacts are within the range of structural balance
    estimates shown in the 2013-14 MYEFO and do not affect the result that the budget was projected to
    remain in structural deficit throughout the medium-term projections period at the 2013-14 MYEFO and
    is now projected to reach structural balance in around 2018-19.

    APPENDIX A: SENSITIVITY OF THE BUDGET TO ECONOMIC
                                DEVELOPMENTS


SENSITIVITY OF BUDGET ESTIMATES TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

The estimates contained in the 2014-15 Budget are based on forecasts of the economic
outlook. Changes to the economic assumptions underlying the estimates will impact
on receipts and payments, and hence the size of the underlying cash balance. Even
small movements in economic parameters can result in large changes to the budget
aggregates.

This section examines the effects on receipts and payments of altering some of the key
economic assumptions. Tables A2 and A4 illustrate the sensitivity of key components
of receipts and payments to possible variations in the economic outlook. The two
scenarios considered are:

    Scenario 1: a 1 percent reduction in nominal GDP owing to a fall in the terms of
•
    trade.

    Scenario 2: a 1 percent increase in real GDP driven by an increase in labour
•
    productivity and labour force participation, with each contributing equally.

The economic scenarios provide a rule of thumb indication of the impact on receipts,
payments and the underlying cash balance of changes in the economic outlook. They
represent a partial economic analysis only and do not attempt to capture all the
economic feedback and other policy responses related to changed economic
conditions. In particular, the analysis assumes no change in the exchange rate, interest
rates or policy over the forecast period. The impact of the two scenarios on the
economic parameters would be different if the full feedback response on economic
variables and likely policy actions were taken into account. The analysis does not aim
to provide an alternative picture of the economic forecasts under these scenarios, but
instead gives an indication of the sensitivity associated with different components of
receipts and payments to changes in the economy. As such, the changes in the
economic variables and their impact on the fiscal outlook are merely illustrative.

The impacts shown in the tables below are broadly symmetrical. That is, impacts of
around the same magnitude, but in the opposite direction, would apply if the terms of
trade were to increase or if real GDP were to decrease.


Scenario 1
The first scenario involves a permanent fall in world prices of non-rural commodity
exports in 2014-15 consistent with a fall in the terms of trade of around 4 percent,
which causes a 1 percent fall in nominal GDP by 2015-16. The sensitivity analysis

Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook

evaluates the flow-on effects on the economy, the labour market and prices. The
impacts in Table A1 are stylised and refer to percent deviations from the baseline
levels of the economic parameters.

Assuming no change in exchange rates or interest rates, the fall in export prices leads
directly to a lower non-farm GDP deflator (from the export component of GDP) and
lower domestic incomes. Lower domestic incomes cause both consumption and
investment to fall, resulting in lower real GDP, employment and wages. The fall in
aggregate demand puts downward pressure on domestic prices.

In reality, a fall in the terms of trade would be expected to lead to a fall in the exchange
rate, although the magnitude is particularly uncertain in the short term. In the event of
a fall in the exchange rate, the impacts on the external sector would dampen the real
GDP effects, and there would be some offsetting upward pressure on domestic prices.

Given these assumptions, the overall impact of the fall in the terms of trade is a
decrease in the underlying cash balance of around $2.6 billion in 2014-15 and around
$5.4 billion in 2015-16 (see Table A2).

(a) Estimated impacts fall within the 70 percent confidence intervals for years 2014-15 and 2015-16, as
    shown in Appendix B Charts B3 to B5.


On the receipts side, a fall in the terms of trade results in a fall in nominal GDP which
reduces tax collections. The largest impact is on company tax receipts as the fall in
export income decreases company profits. Owing to lags in the tax system, the effect
on company tax is larger in 2015-16. Lower company profits are assumed to flow
through to lower Australian equity prices, therefore reducing capital gains tax from
individuals, companies and superannuation funds.

The weaker economy results in lower aggregate demand, which flows through to
lower employment and wages, reducing individuals’ income tax receipts. The decrease
in disposable incomes leads to lower consumption, which in turn results in a decrease
in GST receipts (decreasing GST payments to the states by the same amount) and other
indirect taxes.

On the payments side, a significant proportion of government expenditure is partially
indexed to movements in costs (as reflected in various price and wage measures).
Some forms of expenditure, in particular income support payments, are also driven by
the number of beneficiaries.

The overall estimated expenditure on income support payments (including pensions
and allowances) increases in both years because of a higher number of unemployment
benefit recipients. The increase in spending on unemployment benefits in 2015-16 is
partly offset by reduced expenditure on pensions and allowances reflecting lower
growth in benefit rates resulting from lower wages growth and lower inflation. At the
same time other payments linked to inflation fall in line with the reduced growth in
prices.




                                                 3-33
Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook

The reduction in the underlying cash balance results in a higher borrowing
requirement and a higher public debt interest cost.

As noted above, under a floating exchange rate, the fall in the exchange rate would
dampen the effects of the fall in the terms of trade on real GDP, meaning the impact on
the fiscal position could be substantially more subdued. Also, to the extent that the fall
in the terms of trade is temporary rather than permanent, the impact on the economic
and fiscal position would be more subdued.


Scenario 2
The second scenario involves a permanent 0.5 percent increase in both the
participation rate and labour productivity, resulting in a 1 percent increase in real
GDP from 2014-15. Once again, the sensitivity analysis evaluates the flow-on effects on
the economy, the labour market and prices. The impacts in Table A3 are stylised and
refer to percent deviations from the baseline levels of the parameters.

The 1 percent increase in real GDP increases nominal GDP by slightly less but the
magnitude of the effects on receipts, payments and the underlying cash balance differ
from the first scenario because different parts of the economy are affected in different
ways.

The increases in labour force participation and labour productivity have the same
impact on output, but different impacts on the labour market. Higher productivity
leads to higher real GDP and higher real wages, while an increase in the participation
rate increases employment and real GDP. Imports are higher in this scenario, reflecting
higher domestic incomes.

Since the supply side of the economy expands, inflation falls relative to the baseline.
The lower domestic prices make exports more attractive to foreigners, with the
resulting increase in exports offsetting higher imports, leaving the trade balance
unchanged. The exchange rate is assumed to be unchanged.

The overall impact of the increase in labour productivity and participation is an

(a) Estimated impacts fall within the 70 percent confidence intervals for years 2014-15 and 2015-16, as

On the receipts side, individuals’ income tax collections increase because of the rise in
the number of wage earners and, additionally, higher real wages. The stronger labour
market also increases tax collections from superannuation funds because contributions
(including compulsory contributions) are higher. The increase in personal incomes
leads to higher consumption which results in an increase in GST receipts (with the
corresponding receipts passed on in higher GST payments to the states). In addition,
the stronger economy results in higher levels of corporate profitability, increasing
company taxes.

On the payments side, overall estimated expenditure on income support payments
(including pensions, unemployment benefits and other allowances) is higher,
reflecting a higher number of unemployment benefit recipients (as higher labour force
participation increases both employment and the number unemployed) and also
growth in benefit rates through their indexation to wages. Lower inflation has a
partially offsetting effect.

On balance, the rise in estimated tax collections is only partially offset by increased
payments. This improves the underlying cash position, which results in a lower
borrowing requirement and lower public debt interest cost.

If increases in productivity and participation are temporary rather than permanent, the
impact on the economic and fiscal position would be more subdued.

Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook


SENSITIVITY OF THE BALANCE SHEET TO ECONOMIC AND FISCAL RISKS
Consistent with the medium-term fiscal strategy, this Budget places emphasis on the
strength of the Government’s balance sheet. This section supplements the analysis of
Australia’s fiscal sustainability in Statement 3, and discusses the resilience of our
balance sheet to adverse economic and fiscal shocks. The baseline case and the
downside scenario are analysed:

    Baseline case: discussion of how current economic and fiscal risks may impact the
•
    balance sheet.

    Downside scenario: discussion of how significant but remote economic and fiscal
•
    downside risks may impact the balance sheet.

A strong balance sheet provides the Government with the flexibility to respond to
adverse fiscal and economic risks, and is an indicator of fiscal sustainability. Fiscal
risks refer to developments or specific events that are unpredictable in both timing and
magnitude, which result in a significant increase in Government payments. This
includes events such as emergency defence or foreign aid requirements and natural
disasters. These payments generally result in an erosion of existing budget surpluses
and/or higher government borrowings. Economic risks refer to economic shocks, such
as a financial crisis, that result in a fall in GDP, employment, wages and therefore tax
receipts, and increased payments for example for unemployment benefits. These
effects generally result in lower receipts and higher payments, eroding surpluses or
widening deficits and resulting in higher levels of net debt.

This analysis focuses on the impact of large risks eventuating and the impact to the
balance sheet and fiscal sustainability in broad terms.

Baseline case
The estimates contained in the Budget are based on forecasts of the economic and fiscal
outlook. Risks that have a probable chance of materialising are already taken into
account in the Financial Statements. Australia holds AAA credit ratings from all three
rating agencies, and the balance sheet is strong given current economic conditions.

There are a number of existing contingent liabilities and assets that are not included in
the Financial Statements on the basis that they are currently assessed as unlikely to
occur, but under certain and potentially extreme circumstances they could crystallise
in the future. These contingencies include loan guarantees, warranties, indemnities,
uncalled capital and letters of comfort, and are outlined in Statement 8: Statement of
Risks.

Downside scenario
If fiscal or economic risks come to fruition, the strength of the balance sheet is called
upon as it will need to respond to the initial shock to the economy or the budget. In a


                                           3-36
                                                     Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook

large economic shock, the Government will likely be pressed to intervene in a riskier
environment by drawing down assets, issuing more debt and/or providing guarantees
to give certainty to the market. This poses a challenge to the Government and tests the
ability and strength of the balance sheet to support economic activity and so
ameliorate the impact of the shock on businesses and households.

A higher level of payments necessitating higher borrowings
When economic conditions deteriorate the budget position can decline significantly as
receipts fall and payments increase. This can lead to an erosion of existing budget
surpluses and/or an increase in borrowings to fund these additional payments. The
section below discusses how a number of fiscal and economic risks increase payments
if they materialise.

A deterioration in economic conditions and economic activity is usually signalled by a
fall in demand for labour and for goods and services. Eventually excess supply in
product and labour markets will generate falls in wages and domestic prices, and the
quantity of labour employed and goods and services exchanged. The decline in wages
and employment will lead to a fall in personal income tax receipts. Weak labour
market conditions would also lead to lower household consumption and falls in GST
receipts. The fall in nominal GDP (driven by falls in domestic prices and the level of
goods and services exchanged) reduces revenue raised from company tax. At the same
time a higher unemployment rate would lead to increased expenditure on income and
other Government support payments. To fund this deterioration in the Government’s
fiscal position, assets would need to be run down or borrowings would need to
increase through the issuance of more Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS).

During an economic downturn, increases in payments could be funded by an increase
in CGS issuance thereby increasing the liability. This would lead to higher interest
payments until the Government begins to repay its debt.

A weakened economic environment also increases the likelihood of contingent
liabilities (for example, guarantees) crystallising or defaults on loans, resulting in
higher liabilities and an increase in payments.

Statement 8 provides further detail on contingent liabilities, contingent assets and
other fiscal risks. Information on contingent assets and liabilities is also provided in the
Australian Government’s annual consolidated financial statements and in the annual
financial reports of departments and non-budget entities.

Some of the Government’s large guarantees are those introduced during the Global
Financial Crisis. As described below, even a large deterioration in conditions would be
unlikely to trigger some of these guarantees.

The Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding is applicable to
certain liabilities covered by the guarantee. The liabilities currently have a value of
around $25 billion. Government expenditure would only arise in the unlikely event

                                           3-37
Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook

that an institution failed to meet its obligations with respect to a commitment that was
subject to the guarantee and the guarantee was called upon. In such a case, the
Government would likely be able to recover any such expenditure through a claim on
the relevant institution.

The Financial Claims Scheme provides depositors of authorised deposit taking
institutions (ADIs) and policyholders of general insurers with timely access to their
funds in the event of a financial institution failure. In relation to ADIs payments are
capped at $250,000 per account holder per ADI, and a mechanism exists to make
payments to eligible beneficiaries with a claim against a failed insurer. ADI deposits
eligible for coverage under the scheme are estimated to be approximately $722.8 billion
at 31 December 2013. Initial amounts available to meet payments and administer the
scheme are $20.1 billion per institution. In the unlikely event of a failure, any payments
made under the Financial Claims Scheme would be recovered through a liquidation of
the failed institution. Any shortfalls would be recovered through a levy on the
industry.

The IMF has analysed and tested the financial strength of Australian banks in its
Financial Stability Assessment Programme Report 2012. The report found that
Australia’s financial system is sound, resilient, and well-managed, and that the major
banks are conservatively run, well capitalised and profitable, and they are likely to
withstand severe shocks. The IMF concluded that if necessary, given Australia’s
modest public debt, there is space for both monetary and fiscal policy to respond to a
significant shock.1

The guarantee of State and Territory Borrowings, also introduced in response to the
considerable financial market turbulence in the Global Financial Crisis, only applies to
outstanding securities for New South Wales and Queensland covered by the guarantee
before it closed on 31 December 2010. As at 31 March 2014, the face value of
guaranteed securities was $19.0 billion. While the risk of default of either government
is remote, if a significant economic event were to cause a default by either or both
governments, the Commonwealth is likely to be able to recover its guarantee payments
through a claim on the relevant State or Territory at a future date.

In addition to payments resulting from shocks to the economy, natural disasters are
highly unpredictable and are outside the Government’s control. They can pose
devastating consequences on the Australian community and result in large unexpected
increases in payments for disaster aid and recovery funding. While the Government’s
current balance sheet strength is able to provide capacity for further borrowings
without putting at risk existing spending programmes and Australia’s debt
sustainability, if a natural disaster occurs in conjunction with a significant economic
downturn, the burden on the Government’s finances would put further pressure on
the budget.

A fall in the strength of the balance sheet
In addition to an increase in borrowings, certain balance sheet items are required to be
recorded at market value and the market valuation of these items make them
susceptible to significant economic downturns as prices fluctuate. As a result market
movements may have temporary impacts on the strength of the balance sheet.

The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is the largest asset on the balance sheet,
in terms of individual programs, and represents the net present value of expected loan
repayments and therefore future sources of funds. The HELP asset is estimated to be
around $25.2 billion at 30 June 2014 and is projected to grow to around $30.0 billion in
2014-15 and $51.4 billion by the end of the forward estimates. This growth is largely a
result of improved access to student loans and students paying a greater share of the
cost of their education. A slow-down in wages growth as a result of a deterioration of
economic conditions may lead to slower loan repayments meaning the government
cannot repay its debt as quickly.

The investments of the Future Fund are also susceptible to market changes. The Future
Fund’s investments are estimated to be around $97.6 billion at 31 March 2014.
However, if the Future Fund were to experience negative returns on its investments
due to an external financial market shock, its value could fall substantially.

The CGS liability is estimated to be $346.6 billion as at 30 June 2014. Movements in
interest rates impact upon the market value of the Government’s CGS liability. For
example, lower interest rates that may be used to stimulate the economy will
contribute to a higher market value of the liability. This increases the market value of
the CGS liability.

        APPENDIX B: CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AROUND THE
              ECONOMIC AND FISCAL FORECASTS
Estimates of economic and fiscal variables over the forward estimates period are
subject to inherent uncertainties, which generally tend to increase as the forecast
horizon lengthens. Confidence intervals quantifying estimates of uncertainty around
the key 2014-15 Budget forecasts have been constructed using a set of historical
forecasting errors based on forecasts made since 1998 (where errors are defined by the
difference between the forecasts and actual outcomes). These confidence intervals
highlight that there is a range of plausible alternative outcomes around any given
point estimate and provide a guide to the degree of uncertainty around these forecasts,
typically spanning a wide range of outcomes.1 As part of continuing to improve its
forecasting processes, Treasury is implementing the recommendations of the
2012 Review of Treasury Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting.


MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND ECONOMIC FORECASTS
For real and nominal GDP forecasts, confidence intervals could be presented around
forecasts of annual growth rates, average annualised growth rates or cumulative
growth rates. While all three measures have merit, a key role of GDP forecasts is as an
input for producing revenue and expenses forecasts. For this purpose, the average
annualised GDP growth rate or cumulative GDP growth rate is the more relevant
summary statistic, since the level of GDP depends on cumulative growth over time.
The average annualised growth rate is reported as it captures the effects of cumulative
growth, while still giving a sense of what the annual growth rate would be.

Chart B1 suggests that the average annualised growth rate in real GDP in the two
years to 2014-15 is expected to be 2½ percent, with the 70 percent confidence interval
ranging from 1¾ to 3½ percent. In other words, if forecast errors are similar to those in
the past 15 years, there is a 70 percent probability that the growth rate will lie in this
range.




1   The 2012 Review of Treasury Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting found that the official
    macroeconomic and tax revenue forecasting performance is comparable with or better than
    that of other forecasters, suggesting that the uncertainty around the forecasts is similar to or
    smaller than those of other forecasters.

The uncertainty around nominal GDP is larger, reflecting uncertainty about the
outlook for real GDP and uncertainty about the outlook for prices or the GDP deflator.
Chart B2 suggests that the average annualised growth rate in nominal GDP in the two
years to 2014-15 is expected to be 3½ percent, with the 70 percent confidence interval
ranging from 2 to 5 percent.

Statement 3: Fiscal strategy and outlook


MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND FISCAL FORECASTS
The following charts illustrate measures of uncertainty around the key 2014-15 Budget
fiscal forecasts. These charts show confidence intervals around the forecasts for
receipts (excluding GST and including Future Fund earnings), payments (excluding
GST) and the underlying cash balance (which excludes Future Fund earnings). These
confidence intervals have been calculated by comparing the historical forecasts of the
relevant fiscal variable with the outcome, expressed as a proportion of the GDP
outcome in the relevant year.2

Impacts of future policy decisions are beyond the scope of fiscal forecasts. To account
for this, confidence intervals constructed around the fiscal variables exclude historical
variations caused by policy decisions. These intervals take into account errors caused
by parameter and other variations in isolation, but include the public debt interest
impact of policy decisions.3

It should be noted that excluding historical variations due to policy decisions does not
exclude cases that are classified in budget documentation as parameter and other
variations, but have more in common with decisions of government. For example,
specific decisions to re‐profile spending due to changes in timing of projects are
captured for reporting purposes as parameter and other variations. Similarly, new and
often substantial spending decisions to provide assistance for the impacts of natural
disasters are covered under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and
are captured for budget reporting purposes as parameter and other variations. The
treatment of these spending decisions contributes to the size of the confidence intervals
around payments. Further uncertainty from this source can be expected over the
forecast period as provisions for impacts of future natural disasters are not included in
estimates beyond the budget year.

GST was not reported as a Commonwealth tax in budget documents prior to the
2008‑09 Budget. As a result, GST data have been removed from historical receipts and
payments data to abstract from any error associated with this change in accounting
treatment.




2   The confidence intervals around the fiscal forecasts are based on GDP outcomes, rather than
    GDP forecasts, as discussed in Treasury Working Paper 2013-04: Estimates of uncertainty
    around budget forecasts which found that forecast errors for GDP and receipts (in particular)
    are highly correlated.
3   The impacts of past policy decisions on historical public debt interest through time cannot be
    readily identified or estimated. For this reason, no adjustment has been made to exclude
    these impacts from the analysis.

Chart B3 suggests that there is notable uncertainty around receipts forecasts and that
this uncertainty increases over the estimates period. It suggests that in 2014-15, the
width of the 70 percent confidence interval for the 2014-15 Budget receipts forecast
(excluding GST) is approximately 1.8 percent of GDP ($30 billion) and the 90 percent
confidence interval is approximately 2.9 percent of GDP ($45 billion).

     STATEMENT 4: SUSTAINING STRONG GROWTH IN
                             LIVING STANDARDS

INTRODUCTION
Australians have high living standards relative to the rest of the world, and these have
been boosted by rapid growth in incomes over the past two decades. This income
growth has been shared broadly across the community.

To a large extent, this growth in national average incomes reflects the pay offs from
economic reforms undertaken previously that increased the economy’s productive
potential, opened up access to overseas markets and capital, and made businesses
more competitive.

Australia now faces a number of challenges that are likely to slow growth in incomes
in the future. Australia’s population is ageing, which means that we will continue to
see a lower proportion of our population in the workforce. In addition, Australia’s
terms of trade have fallen from their historic highs and are projected to continue to fall
over the next few years.

For incomes to grow in the future, we will have to pursue new growth opportunities
and use our resources more productively. Ultimately, it is the efforts, creativity and
risk-taking of businesses, investors and workers together that create new and better
goods and services, and more efficient ways of doing things. This then creates wealth,
jobs and opportunities. Government policies and decisions influence how well markets
operate and incentives for work and enterprise, and can have a profound impact on
current and future rates of economic growth.

There is significant scope for structural reforms to improve the productive potential of
the Australian economy. At the heart of the changes required is a mindset and culture
that rewards individuals’ and firms’ hard work and initiative. This change in mindset
needs to be shared by all sectors of society, including individuals, business and
government. On the Government’s part, this requires changes to policy settings to
encourage people to work and to innovate, and which promote greater openness and
competition in markets. This Budget makes a significant down payment on these
reforms.

This Budget also begins the task of restoring discipline to public spending while also
re-focusing spending to areas that build the economy’s productive capabilities.
Importantly, this Budget will help the economy to transition from the end of the
resources investment boom, including by facilitating targeted infrastructure
investment.

Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards


LIVING STANDARDS IN AUSTRALIA
A major goal of policy is to improve the level and sustainability of living standards of
all Australians.

Income is one of the most important determinants of living standards. Increasing real
incomes allow people the capacity to buy more goods and services, and save and
invest, as well as more freedom to choose how to spend their time. Income growth also
means that potentially more tax revenue is available to provide government services
and income support.

Australians’ incomes per person are now relatively high in comparison to most
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies
(Chart 1). Average income levels per person were around $34,500 in 2012. In the past
two decades, average incomes have grown in dollar terms by around $12,000 (after
discounting for the effects of inflation), and at annual rates that are among the fastest
in the OECD.

Australia’s income growth has been broadly shared across the Australian population,
with households across the income distribution experiencing broadly similar rates of
income growth (after taxes and transfers) over the past two decades.

This growth in incomes has contributed to higher living standards over time, and
relative to other countries.

                                   Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

Indicators of Australians’ life expectancy, education levels and the quality of our urban
environment all improved over the past decade.1 International comparisons of living
standards indicate that Australians have among the highest living standards in the
world, and that these high standards of living are shared relatively equitably across
the community in comparison to other advanced countries.2

Our high standards of living did not come about by accident.

In significant part, they reflect a range of reforms taken by governments, particularly
during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s that led to improvements in the economy’s
productive capacity and the competitiveness of businesses, as well as greater openness
to overseas markets and capital.

It also reflects behavioural responses to those policy changes that saw employers and
employees having greater flexibility in negotiating how income gains are shared, and
reforms that have supported higher, and better skilled, participation in the workforce.


DRIVERS OF GROWTH IN INCOMES
The main sources of income growth nationally are growth in productivity, changes in
the terms of trade, changes in output from increased labour utilisation, and growth in
net foreign income.

Chart 2 shows the sources of growth in real national income per person over the past
half century. It also shows two scenarios for income growth in the future given the
likely impacts of population ageing and the projected falls in the terms of trade.

Productivity has consistently been the most significant source of income growth.
However, over the past decade or so, it has been the dramatic rise in the terms of trade
which has maintained growth in gross national income as productivity growth has
waned. Over the next decade, the decline in the terms of trade is expected to detract
from growth in incomes. This negative impact will be compounded by a declining
contribution from labour utilisation as the population ages.

For annual incomes to grow at their historical average of 2.3 percent over the period to
2025, annual labour productivity growth would need to increase to around 3 percent
per year to counteract the effects of population ageing and a falling terms of trade. This
is well in excess of what has been achieved in the past 50 years, and more than double
what was achieved in the past decade.

If labour productivity grows at its long-run average of around 1.5 percent per year
over the medium-term, per capita incomes would grow on average by about 1 percent
per year — or less than half of what Australians have become used to over the past
three decades. This difference in growth rates translates to a difference in real
per capita incomes of $13,000 per year by 2025 ($84,000 under the high growth scenario
versus $71,000 under the low growth scenario) — or around 20 percent of today’s
average income of $63,500. The drivers of income growth are discussed further below.

Productivity growth
Growth in productivity means that more or better quality goods and services are
generated for a given level of resources.

What happened in the 1990s?
Labour productivity grew strongly in the 1990s, at an annual average rate of
2.1 percent, well above the long-run average of 1.5 percent.3 Productivity accounted
for about 96 percent of annual income growth in that decade, in comparison to an
average of 90 percent of growth in incomes in the past four decades.

The increase in productivity growth rates seen in the 1990s was the payoff from the
significant policy reforms of that decade and in the 1980s. These included removing
industry protections and opening up the economy to overseas trade; reducing controls
over labour, capital and product markets; reforms to improve the efficiency of markets
providing essential services, such as electricity; and taxation reforms. Reforms were
also made to macroeconomic policy settings, including letting market forces determine
the exchange rate, introducing the independent setting of interest rates and placing
fiscal policy in a medium term framework.

The reforms created more competitive markets, which encouraged businesses to
become more efficient and innovative. The reforms also encouraged businesses to
adopt and exploit new and improved technologies developed overseas, including
those embedded in new capital, such as information and communications
technologies. Further, they provided greater flexibility in the use of resources and
allowed relative prices of goods and services to reflect the balance of supply and
demand more accurately, improving overall resource allocation and returns on
investments in both physical and human capital.

The productivity and price changes in key infrastructure sectors, such as energy and
water, have been estimated to have increased gross domestic product (GDP) by
2.5 percent above what it would otherwise have been over the 1990s.4 The benefits of
competition reforms were widely spread across the community, including rural and
regional Australia.5

These policy reforms helped halt a long-term decline in Australia’s income growth
rates relative to other countries. Without these reforms, it is likely that Australians’
living standards would be significantly lower than they are today.

Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

What has happened since the early 2000s?
Labour productivity growth has slowed since the early 2000s, contributing only
around 60 percent of the growth in average incomes since 2000. However, incomes
have grown at similar rates over the past 10 years to that recorded in the previous
decade due mainly to a significant contribution from the rise in the terms of trade.

The slowdown in productivity growth since the early 2000s has partly reflected the
very high investment activity in the resources and utilities sectors.6 This investment of
capital and labour has long lead times before increased output comes on line.
Productivity in manufacturing has also been poor at an aggregate level. Further,
cyclical factors may also have played a role since the global financial crisis.7

Still, these factors do not explain fully the breadth and magnitude of the slowdown in
Australia’s productivity growth rates, since the majority of industries have seen a
slowing. This suggests that more fundamental factors are at play.

Part of the slowdown may reflect the fading impact of past reforms. Also, there have
been fewer significant policy reforms since the early 2000s. Strong income growth, low
unemployment, and high rates of profitability through the 2000s may have reduced the
incentive for major reform by governments and for businesses to become more
competitive.8 There is also evidence that policy requirements have constrained how
inputs are used in some sectors and increased regulatory burdens, thereby detracting
from measured productivity growth.9

There is little evidence that slower productivity growth has been due to inadequate
investment in skills, education and innovation more broadly. 10

Australia has not been alone among advanced economies in experiencing slower
productivity growth over the 2000s, which suggests that the rate of growth in


6  The resources sector comprises the mining and metals manufacturing industries as defined
   by the ABS.
7 Productivity performance fluctuates with economic and business cycles. During downturns,
   businesses often lower their utilisation of labour and capital, rather than laying them off.
   This avoids the costs involved in re-employing them when times improve, although it can
   temporarily reduce productivity. Demand conditions in the non-resources sectors of the
   economy have generally been below their long-run trends since the onset of the global
   financial crisis in 2008.
8 See, for example, Eslake, 2011 and Dolman, 2009.
9 Productivity Commission, 2013, IPART, 2010, Eslake, 2011. One prominent example is new
   environmental and water and electricity service standards, which have required many utility
   services to invest in higher cost production technologies.
10 Indicators of innovative activity for Australia generally point to higher rates of innovation in
   the 2000s than in the 1990s (Connolly & Gustafsson, 2013, and Carmody, 2013). When
   adjusted for education and work experience (a proxy for human capital), estimates of labour
   inputs similarly show strong increases across the 2000s.

                                     Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

technological advance — which expands production possibilities — may have been
slower than in previous decades. This is discussed further in the section on the
prospects for long term productivity growth below.

The impact of the resources, utilities and manufacturing sectors
The resources sector has seen significant increases in capacity that have not yet been
matched by growth in output. The rate of productivity growth in the resources sector
is likely to improve as this additional capacity is used for production and exports.11

In addition, high prices for commodities have made activities with higher unit costs,
such as the extraction of deeper ores and lower yielding resources, financially
attractive. The mining of marginal resources is likely to decline as prices for resource
commodities decline — although to the extent that fewer high-value deposits are
discovered, the downward pressure on productivity growth may continue into the
future.12

The resources sector is expected to experience a very strong turnaround in labour
productivity over the next few years. After falling a cumulative 19 percent over the
past five years, labour productivity is projected to return soon to positive rates of
growth as output from the resources sector rises strongly. The resources sector
generates around 16 percent of Australia’s production and is the highest productivity
sector in the economy.13 Therefore, this productivity turnaround will have a sizable
impact on national productivity growth.14

This will not lead to a commensurate increase in national average incomes as a large
part of the resource investment boom (around four-fifths) has been funded from
foreign sources.15 Australians will receive returns from higher productivity growth
that reflect the level of domestic investment in the sector, as well as through
employment income.

Productivity levels in the utilities sector should also increase as utilisation of new
capacity grows, for example, with population growth. The negative impact of other
temporary factors, such as drought, which decreased water output, and expenditure to

13 Methodology for constructing resources sector data as in Gruen, 2011. Sectoral output share
   based on real gross value added.
14 Were labour productivity in the resources sector simply to stop falling, it would raise
   aggregate labour productivity growth by 0.6 percent per annum relative to the past
   five years. Given the sharp increases in output in prospect in the next few years detailed in
   Budget Statement 2, the sector’s contribution to aggregate productivity could be significantly
   larger than this.
15 The estimate of foreign investment funding in the sector is from Arsov, I, Shanahan, B and
   Williams, T, 2013.

Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

refurbish or replace assets, for example ageing electricity infrastructure, is also likely to
diminish in time.

However, the utilities sector has incurred significant expenditure in recent years in
response to policy decisions, including with respect to higher service quality,
reliability, environmental and security standards.16 This could represent a permanent
shift to a lower measured productivity level, although these decisions may still
contribute to higher and more sustainable living standards to the extent that they take
a form of investment akin to insurance.

The manufacturing sector saw a marked slowdown in productivity growth over the
mid-2000s and, given its size, was a major driver of the national productivity
slowdown over this period.17 The diversity of this sector makes it difficult to infer
broad causes of the slowdown in manufacturing productivity, but long-run trends in
the industry show sustained falls in input growth, with larger falls in output growth.

The specific circumstances of these sectors do not explain the aggregate slowing of
productivity growth. After removing the effects of these sectors, the slowdown in
productivity is still seen, and is broad-based across industries. This suggests that
economy-wide factors are at play and there is a need for an economy-wide response.

Chart 3 shows Australia’s growth in multi-factor productivity (MFP), which has been
extremely weak, on average, over the past decade. In contrast to labour productivity,
MFP is a more comprehensive measure of productivity, as it captures how efficiently
producers use both the key inputs of labour and capital. 18 Poor MFP performance over
the past decade contrasts with solid growth on average over the preceding 30 years.




16 These include, for example, the construction of desalination plants to ensure water security
   and asset enhancements to meet higher electricity reliability, water quality and dam safety
   standards.
17 Productivity Commission, 2014.
18 Labour productivity (output produced per unit of labour input) ascribes all the value added
   from resources used in production to labour. As such, it is a more limited measure of the
   efficiency with which firms use their resources than MFP (output produced per unit of
   combined inputs of labour and capital).

What are the prospects for productivity growth in the long term?
The United States (US) is currently the most technologically advanced country. In
general, the US can be said to represent the highest levels of productivity achievable
from the use of existing resources given current knowledge and technologies.

Chart 4 shows that Australia’s productivity levels relative to the US have trended
downwards from around 87 percent at the turn of the century to around 83 percent in
2013.

US labour productivity growth has fallen since 2002 but Australia’s productivity
growth has deteriorated more markedly.

A large part of the productivity gap between Australia and the US is attributable to
differences in historical and geographic circumstances. Australia’s large and sparsely
populated land mass and geographic distance from key global centres of trade limit
opportunities to take advantage of specialisation and economies of scale. Previous
work undertaken in Treasury suggests that these factors could explain around
40 percent of the observed gap in productivity.19

While some Australian industries enjoy higher or similar productivity relative to the
US (such as resources), other industries lag behind, such as utilities, manufacturing,
and wholesale and retail trade. This indicates that there may be further scope to ‘catch
up’ to best practice, particularly within industries where Australia’s productivity is
relatively low.

Longer term, Australia’s prospects for productivity growth will be affected by
advances in technology, which will create new possibilities for production. As a net
importer of technology and innovations, Australia’s ability to absorb advances and
convert them into new business opportunities will be particularly important.

Is the frontier expanding more slowly?
As noted above, Australia has not been alone among advanced economies in
experiencing slower productivity growth over the 2000s. This suggests that the rate of
expansion of the global technological frontier may have been slower than in previous
decades. There is little consensus on the reasons for this apparent slowdown.



19 Davis & Rahman, 2006.



                                                                  4-12
                                     Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

There are also differing views as to the scope in future for major productivity
improvements. Some suggest that the set of innovations seen over the past 250 years
may have been a unique episode in human history. 20

This suggests future innovations will be less productivity enhancing, and income
growth may be lower in future. If this is true, global living standards can increase as
less developed countries get closer to the frontier, but those at or near the frontier may
see a slowdown in income growth.

However, others note that it is not possible to predict when technological change will
occur, or necessarily how and when innovations will change businesses processes, and
what we produce.21

The analyses of slowdowns have generally focused on advanced economies. With the
growth of emerging economies, the sources of global economic growth and creative
enterprise will expand. This may well boost the stock of ‘knowledge workers’
contributing to significant advances in the global technological frontier.

To the extent that Australia is geographically closer to new sources of technological
advance, there should be greater scope to ‘catch up’ to, and move with, best practice.

The impact of structural change
Although the resources sector experienced negative productivity growth in recent
years, it maintained the highest level of labour productivity. Consequently, over the
past decade, the movement of labour to the resources sector has contributed
significantly to aggregate labour productivity growth.

Over the decade ahead, changing industry structure is projected to detract around
0.3 percentage points from the 30-year average labour productivity growth rate of
1.5 percent per year.22 The expansion of low productivity growth sectors, such as
business services, aged care and health, as well as relative declines in high
productivity growth sectors, such as financial services, is projected to reduce growth in
aggregate labour productivity.23




20 For example, Gordon, 2012.
21 As noted by Syverson, 2013, it may simply take time for innovations, such as information
   and communications technologies, to result in significant growth in productivity.
   Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2011, further suggest there is significant growth potential
   stemming from advances in computing and digital technologies that are yet to be seen.
22 Treasury calculations based on the Monash Multi-Regional Forecasting model. This finding
   is consistent with a recent study by the Productivity Commission, (2012).
23 Productivity Commission, 2013a. It is particularly difficult to measure productivity in the
   services sectors. Many public services, for example, are not priced or have prices that do not
   reflect their full costs, and improvements in the quality of services, such as in the areas of



                                             4-13
Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

Australia’s services sectors are expected to become a larger part of the economy. These
sectors currently account for more than three-quarters of total employment and are
expected to grow further to meet growth in domestic and international demand.24
Services sectors tend to be lower-productivity as they are more labour-intensive.

Like Australia, a number of advanced economies are becoming more services-oriented
as lower-cost developing economies compete for export share in higher productivity
manufacturing-oriented sectors.25

The negative impact on aggregate productivity of a shift to labour-intensive service
industries — many of them provided or funded by governments — and their
increasing prominence as a share of the economy highlights the critical importance of
improving productivity in these industries.


Changes in the terms of trade
Over the past decade or so, the second most significant driver of income growth has
been income derived from the largest rise in the terms of trade in our history. The
economic transformation of China and other emerging market economies drove global
prices of Australia’s mineral commodities, and the terms of trade, to record highs. This
enabled strong wage growth in resources-related sectors, while a higher exchange rate
increased the purchasing power of households across the economy. This added
0.8 percentage points a year to growth in average incomes, boosting real incomes
per person by about $6,000 since 2000.

Australia’s terms of trade peaked in 2011, and has been declining ever since. This
decline will continue over coming years as the prices for our key export commodities
fall in response to expanding global supply capacity.26 The falling terms of trade has
already begun to detract from growth in national income, and will continue to do so
over the medium term.




   health and ageing, are difficult to quantify. The true values of these services are, therefore,
   often not reflected in output measures.
24 The international dimension represents predominantly the rapidly increasing membership of
   the Asian middle class with their rising demand for a broad range of services, including
   tourism, education, aged care and health, entertainment, financial and professional services.
   Employment in the Australian services sectors is projected to grow by around 30 percent to
   2030. Gruen, 2014.

                                   Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

Changes in workforce participation
Australia experienced a ‘demographic dividend’ in recent decades like many other
countries. That dividend, which boosted income growth, is coming to an end as the
population ages.

Between 1970 and 2010, the proportion of Australia’s population between 15 and 65
(those most likely to participate in the labour market) increased from 62.8 percent to
67.4 percent, driven by the post-war baby boom and a fall in the birth rate in the 1960s
and 1970s. This increase in the share of the working age population helped underpin
GDP growth, particularly in the 1980s, when labour productivity growth was
relatively slow.

This trend is now beginning to reverse as people who made up that demographic
‘bulge’ begin to retire. The proportion of the population aged 65 and over is expected
to increase to nearly 20 percent in 2030 from 13.5 percent in 2010.

An increasing proportion of older people are continuing to work, but their levels of
participation in the workforce are lower than the average of other groups of working
age.27 This suggests that, as more people move into older age groups, the aggregate
workforce participation rate is set to decline even if individuals in the 65-plus age
group increasingly work beyond traditional retirement ages. In addition, younger
people are delaying entry into working careers, instead choosing lengthier periods of
study, overseas travel, and part-time employment. The combined effect of these
phenomena is already placing downward pressure on participation, a process that is
likely to continue over the coming decade.

Through this workforce participation effect, population ageing is likely to slow
economic growth in coming decades and, in turn, is likely to reduce growth in incomes
and the future revenue base of government. Population ageing is also likely to create
additional demands on government spending, particularly in health, aged care and
pensions. By 2050, it is projected that there will be only 2.7 people of working age to
support each Australian aged 65 and over, compared with five working age people per
aged person in 2010, and 7.5 in 1970.

SUPPORTING FUTURE GROWTH IN LIVING STANDARDS
For living standards to be maintained and grow in the future, Australia needs a
sustainably strong economy and policy settings that maintain the ability of all
households to participate in the opportunities created by growth. Having better



27 The employment rate of workers aged between 55 and 64 has increased from 53.5 percent in
   2005 to 61.4 percent in 2012. This is now well above the OECD and G7 averages of
   approximately 56 percent. Australia ranked 11th amongst the OECD countries in 2012, up
   from 14th in 2005.



                                           4-15
Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

standards of living in the future will also require governments to have the capacity to
provide goods and services and income support to the community, and to respond to
external shocks.

This will require change in policies and mindsets, particularly given the outlook in the
years ahead. Income growth is projected to be below its 20-year average over the next
few years, reflecting the decline in terms of trade and subdued wages growth. The
challenge for governments, businesses and the broader community is to address the
constraints to potential economic growth and make the most of our opportunities.


Improving the flexibility and competitiveness of the economy
An important role for government is ensuring that policies support private effort and
enterprise. Priorities include removing impediments and disincentives to work and
initiative, such as subsidies to unviable businesses and poorly-targeted income
assistance. The Government is firmly of the view that an attitude of entitlement
removes incentives for change and progress, and reduces the scope for improvements
in living standards over the longer term.

Government can also improve conditions for growth by facilitating trade with other
countries and maintaining Australia’s openness to foreign investment. Open markets
give Australians access to overseas goods, finance and new business opportunities,
and require domestic firms to be more dynamic and competitive in order to prosper.

Australia’s continued openness to trade and foreign investment will also facilitate
access to new technologies and ideas, which will be a critical driver of future
productivity growth.

To this end, the Government has concluded free trade negotiations with Japan and
Korea, and will seek to conclude negotiations with China and the regional Trans
Pacific Partnership later this year.

More broadly, Australia’s exporting sectors will have a number of new opportunities
over the decades ahead, including those provided by anticipated increases in demand
for services, agricultural products and high-value manufactures from emerging market
economies. Foreign investment and measures to facilitate trade will allow Australia to
harness these opportunities and benefit from growth in other countries, particularly in
our region.

Competition in both input and product markets is one of the most important drivers of
productivity and income growth. It provides incentives for businesses to be more
efficient and to respond to the needs of their customers, both other businesses and
consumers, creates the incentives for resources to be allocated to their most
value-adding uses, and puts downward pressure on prices. The pressure exerted by
well-functioning capital markets also encourages businesses to innovate and to raise
management performance.


                                           4-16
                                    Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

The flexibility and competiveness of the economy can be enhanced by removing
government regulation where it is not required, or lessening its burden, and ensuring
that frameworks for promoting competition and the efficiency of our labour and
capital markets are suited to the needs of Australia’s evolving economy.

Evidence suggests that there may have been increases in some forms of regulation over
recent years.28 Removing unnecessary obstacles to business formation and investment
by start-up companies is a critical part of establishing an effective innovation system.
High costs of entry and exit have the potential to discourage the type of start-up
companies that often pioneer new technologies and work practices, and may also
shield incumbent firms that may be less efficient from new competitors. 29

The Government has embarked on a programme to reduce regulatory burdens and it
will review the policy frameworks that promote the competitiveness of businesses.

Governments also have an important role in ensuring that the markets for
infrastructure, education and innovation work well, and investing where this will
produce benefits to the broader community.

This Budget provides for substantial investments in infrastructure to support
productivity in the long term. Investment in infrastructure will also be important to
generating economic activity in the near term as the economy transitions from
resources investment-led growth.


Budget prudence and government efficiency
It is important that the Budget be restored to a sustainable basis and that government
improve the productivity of its operations.

The process of restoring the Budget to a sustainable basis can help drive improved
economic conditions in a number of ways. Productivity can be enhanced when
governments live within their means, by allowing expenditure to be redistributed to
productivity-supporting investment and requiring public sector providers to increase
their efficiency and look for innovative solutions.

A sustainable Budget position will also place downward pressure on interest rates and
exchange rates over time and enable fiscal buffers to be built, helping to support
private sector investment activity and providing capacity to respond to future external
shocks.



28 For example, international data on the burden of government regulation score Australia 2.8
   (out of 7, 1 being most burdensome) in 2013-14, compared to 3.2 in 2009-10. Some sectors, for
   example the small business sector, have unduly borne the burden of these changes
   (Productivity Commission, 2013b).
29 Dolman and Gruen, 2012.



                                             4-17
Statement 4: Sustaining strong growth in living standards

Government can improve productivity by simply getting out of the way of business
and individuals. As many government entities do not directly face the discipline of a
competitive market, they are generally less efficient, so reducing or eliminating activity
that can be performed by the private sector can also increase productivity.

Further, the Government can increase public sector productivity by ceasing activities
that can be performed by other levels of government, which reduces unnecessary
duplication and overlap, and undertaking those that it is best placed to do.

The Government’s medium term strategy of returning the Budget to a sustainable
surplus and reducing the government share of the economy over time will free up
resources for the private sector to drive economic growth and create jobs.


CONCLUSION
Australians have enjoyed rapid rates of income growth over the past two decades,
which have contributed to high living standards relative to the rest of the world. With
the terms of trade and population ageing now detracting from income growth,
productivity growth is likely to be the predominant driver of income growth over the
next decade. It is reasonable to expect some improvement in Australia’s productivity
performance from a cyclical turnaround in labour and capital utilisation, particularly
in the resources sector. However, longer-run factors, including a gradual shift toward
lower-productivity industries, make prospects for productivity growth in Australia
more challenging than usual.

Without further effort, the increases in living standards to which we are accustomed
are unlikely to continue into the future. It is imperative that we address inefficiencies
in the economy and get economic settings right.

The Government has started the process of reform by laying out a plan for fiscal repair,
making well-targeted investments in economic infrastructure, and implementing
policy changes that will support business effort and creativity and workforce
participation. The Government will pursue these, and further reforms, over the
medium term.

The 2014-15 Budget forecasts for tax receipts are broadly unchanged since the
2013-14 MYEFO, revised upwards by $1.8 billion in 2014-15 and $2.1 billion over the
four years to 2016-17. Excluding GST, tax receipts are $800 million higher in 2014-15
but $2.4 billion lower over the four years to 2016-17.

While the forecast for nominal GDP is similar to the 2013-14 MYEFO, forecast
changes in the composition of growth have affected the composition of tax receipts.
Household consumption and corporate profits have been revised up resulting in
higher expected GST and company tax, while softer expected wage growth means
lower expected individuals and superannuation fund taxes. Overall, these factors
weaken the outlook for tax receipts. These variations have been broadly offset by
policy decisions, including the Temporary Budget Repair Levy.

The tax-to-GDP ratio is broadly unchanged since the 2013-14 MYEFO.

                               STATEMENT 5: REVENUE

OVERVIEW
Relative to the 2013-14 MYEFO, expected tax receipts have been revised upwards by
around $1.8 billion in 2014-15 and $2.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17. Excluding
GST, tax receipts have been revised up around $800 million in 2014-15 but down
$2.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17. As GST is paid to the states, tax receipts
excluding GST represent the revenue available to the Australian Government.

Excluding policy, changes in the forecasts for the nominal economy have reduced
expected tax receipts. Stronger expected company profits and household consumption
have resulted in upward revisions to company tax and GST totalling around
$9.2 billion over the four years to 2016-17. This has been partially offset by weaker
expected wage growth contributing to the write-down of individuals and
superannuation fund taxes over the forward estimates totalling around $7.3 billion. In
addition, tobacco excise and customs duties estimates as well as resource rent taxes
forecasts have in total been revised down $3.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17.

Total tax receipts as a percent of GDP are expected to increase from 21.6 percent in
2013-14 to 23.2 percent by the end of the forward estimates, an increase of
1.7 percentage points (Table 1). However, excluding GST the tax-to-GDP ratio is
expected to increase by 1.5 percentage points.

The upward revision in tax receipts in 2014-15 is primarily driven by stronger
anticipated wage growth in 2014-15 since the 2013-14 MYEFO. However, over the
remaining forward years, wages are expected to grow less strongly relative to the
2013-14 MYEFO.

Abstracting from policy decisions, tax receipts have been revised down $2.9 billion
over the four years to 2016-17 since the 2013-14 MYEFO. Policy measures add
$5.0 billion to tax receipts over the four years to 2016-17. These measures include
reintroducing the indexation of fuel excise, introducing a temporary levy on
individuals’ taxable incomes above $180,000 and removing poorly targeted tax
concessions. Since the 2013 PEFO, policy decisions have lowered tax receipts by
$2.7 billion over the four years to 2016-17. For more details on revenue and expense
measures introduced at this Budget, refer to Budget Paper 2.
The 2013-14 MYEFO made provisions for a number of election commitments that were
still subject to finalisation at the time. These provisions related to the introduction of a
1.5 percent company levy to fund the new Paid Parental Leave Scheme, as well as the
associated increased income and superannuation taxes flowing from the scheme and
the reduction in company tax rate to 28.5 percent. In addition, a provision was made
for the impact of a free trade agreement with Korea and for unfunded superannuation
liabilities relating to New South Wales universities.

The MYEFO provision for the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and unfunded
superannuation liabilities relating to New South Wales universities have now been
removed as these impacts are included as measures in the 2014-15 Budget.
The 2014-15 Budget provisions for the Japan Economic Partnership agreement as well
as continuing to provision for the introduction of a 1.5 percent company levy to fund
the new Paid Parental Leave Scheme and reduction in the company tax rate to
28.5 percent.


TAX OUTLOOK
Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, tax receipts, abstracting from policy, are broadly unchanged
over the forward estimates. Expected tax receipts are lower in 2013-14 largely driven
by lower than expected year-to-date collections, while across the forward estimates tax
receipts have been affected by broadly offsetting revisions to different components of
nominal GDP.

Spare capacity in the labour market has weakened the outlook for wages which is
more than offset by stronger expected corporate profits, driven by higher than
previously anticipated domestic prices in early 2013-14. Household consumption is
expected to be higher as the household sector continues to respond to low interest
rates. For more details on the economic outlook see Budget Statement 2.

The downgrade to anticipated wage growth has resulted in a downward revision to
individuals tax of around $4.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17. Stronger forecast
gross operating surplus (GOS), the National Accounts measure of corporate profits,
has resulted in company tax being revised upwards over the four years to 2016-17 by
$4.7 billion since the 2013-14 MYEFO. In addition, higher than expected consumption
has also led to a significant revision to GST receipts which are forecast to increase by
around $4.5 billion over the four years to 2016-17.

Forecast superannuation fund taxes are expected to be lower relative to the
2013-14 MYEFO, down $330 million in 2013-14 and $2.9 billion over the four years to
2016-17. The revision is primarily due to lower expected capital gains tax.

Total capital gains receipts have been revised down by around $4.3 billion over the
four years to 2016-17. This has been primarily driven by lower expected
superannuation funds capital gains tax.

Including policy, revisions to forecast tax receipts mean the tax-to-GDP ratio is also
broadly unchanged since the 2013-14 MYEFO, returning to and increasing above the
20-year average of 22.4 percent by the end of the forward estimates.

The tax-to-GDP ratio does not show the government’s total call on community
resources, which is a measure of the amount of receipts and borrowings required to
fund government activities. By including government borrowings, the government’s
call on resources falls gradually over the medium-term in marked contrast to the path
of the previous six years (Chart 1).

Another aspect affecting the tax outlook is the revised medium-term economic
projection methodology. The 2014-15 Budget adopts a new framework, which allows
for a reduction in the spare capacity in the economy — a closing of the output gap —
over the five years following the detailed forecast period. Although nominal GDP is
higher as a result of the new methodology, compositional changes result in slower
wage growth and higher corporate profits growth. These changes result in lower
forecast total tax receipts, down $700 million in 2016-17 and $600 million in 2017-18
(Table 3). For more details on the revised medium-term economic projection
methodology see Budget Statement 2.

Variations in receipts can stem from either policy changes or parameter and other
variations — that is, recent economic conditions, the updated economic outlook,
year-to-date tax collections, and other non-policy factors. The key economic
parameters that influence receipts are shown in Table 7. Analysis of the sensitivity of
the tax receipts estimates to changes in the economic outlook is provided in Budget
Statement 3 (Appendix A).

Relative to the 2013-14 MYEFO, parameter and other variations have reduced tax
receipts by $1.8 billion in 2013-14, increased tax receipts by $1.2 billion in 2014-15, and
decreased them by $2.9 billion over the four years to 2016-17 (Chart 3). Excluding GST,
from the effect of parameter and other variations, forecast tax receipts have declined
by $2.6 billion in 2013-14, increased by around $150 million in 2014-15 and declined by
around $7.4 billion over the four years to 2016-17.

In aggregate, tax receipts are expected to grow by 4.7 percent in 2013-14 and
5.5 percent in 2014-15. At a disaggregated level, different revenue heads are expected
to grow at different rates.


Individuals’ income and other withholding taxation receipts
Receipts from gross income tax withholding (ITW) are forecast to grow by 4.6 percent
in 2013-14 and 8.1 percent in 2014-15. Excluding measures, relative to the 2013-14
MYEFO, softer than expected wages growth has resulted in a downward revision to
gross ITW receipts of $6.1 billion over the four years to 2016-17. ITW receipts have also
been affected by new policy decisions, including the Temporary Budget Repair Levy
from 2014-15.

Gross receipts from other individuals (OI) are expected to grow by 2.7 percent
in 2013-14 and 8.5 percent in 2014-15. Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, OI receipts excluding
measures, are expected to be $200 million higher in 2013-14 and around $250 million
higher over the four years. These upwards revisions are driven by slightly stronger
than expected collections in 2013-14 and expected wages and salaries growth in
2013-14 and 2014-15. OI has also been affected by the Temporary Budget Repair Levy
from 2014-15.

Income tax refunds for individuals, which have a negative effect on receipts,
are expected to grow by 1.1 percent in 2013-14 and 2.2 percent in 2014-15. Relative to
the 2013-14 MYEFO, refunds are expected to be lower (an increase in overall tax
receipts) excluding measures, revised down $100 million in 2013-14 and $1.5 billion
over the four years to 2016-17. This has been driven by weaker than expected payouts

                                                                  Statement 5: Revenue

for refunds in 2013-14 and lower anticipated individuals income tax over the forward
estimates. The removal of the Mature Age Workers Tax Offset and Dependent Spouse
Tax Offset, which had become outdated or poorly targeted, are expected to also affect
refunds.


Fringe benefits tax
Tax receipts from fringe benefits tax (FBT) are forecast to grow by 4.3 percent in
2013-14 and 6.6 percent in 2014-15. Excluding measures, tax receipts from FBT are
unchanged in 2013-14 but $450 million lower over the four years to 2016-17 relative to
the 2013-14 MYEFO. The downward revision over the forward estimates is driven by
softer expected wage growth. FBT receipts have also been affected by the Temporary
Budget Repair Levy from 2014-15.


Company tax
Company tax receipts are expected to grow by 1.6 percent in 2013-14 and 5.3 percent
in 2014-15. Relative to the 2013-14 MYEFO, tax receipts from companies excluding
measures are expected to be around $1.0 billion lower in 2013-14 owing to lower than
expected collections relating to the 2012-13 income year. Further information on the
reasons for this weakness will become available with more tax return data. Over the
four years to 2016-17, company tax receipts have been revised up by around
$4.7 billion reflecting higher corporate profitability.


Superannuation fund taxes
Superannuation funds receipts are expected to decline by 14.8 percent in 2013-14 and
grow by 17.6 percent in 2014-15. The large growth rate in 2014-15 is driven by
superannuation capital gains tax recovering from historical lows of the previous four
years. Excluding measures, since the 2013-14 MYEFO, receipts are expected to be
around $330 million lower in 2013-14 and $2.9 billion over the four years to 2016-17
largely reflecting a revision to anticipated superannuation capital gains tax with
weaker wages also contributing.


Resource rent taxes
Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, minerals resource rent tax (MRRT) receipts have been
revised down by $330 million in 2013-14 and $300 million in 2014-15. The 2014-15 nil
estimate takes into account balancing payments and refunds from the 2013-14 year.

Petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) receipts are forecast to decline by 7.1 percent in
2013-14 and grow by 39.3 percent in 2014-15. The growth rate in 2014-15 is driven by
increased production from 2013-14 to 2014-15 as well as the timing of payments.
Excluding measures, PRRT receipts have been revised down by $350 million in 2013-14
and around $1.3 billion over the four years to 2016-17 since the 2013-14 MYEFO. These
revisions reflect lower expected profitability of PRRT liable entities.

Statement 5: Revenue


 Box 1: The MRRT has raised much less than originally forecast

 This Budget confirms that receipts from the mining tax are a small fraction of what
 was originally estimated under the former government.

 When the resource super profits tax (RSPT) was announced in May 2010, it was
 forecast to raise $12.0 billion in its first two years, and $49.5 billion over five years.

 In July 2010, the former government announced it would introduce a modified
 mining tax from 1 July 2012, the minerals resource rent tax (MRRT), in place of the
 RSPT. Forecast receipts from the MRRT were $10.5 billion over the first two years,
 and $26.5 billion over five years (Chart A).

 In contrast, the Final Budget Outcome for 2012-13 revealed that in its first year, the
 MRRT raised just $200 million, or 5 percent of the amount originally estimated. The
 shortfall in collections was driven by a combination of lower Australian dollar
 commodity prices and design elements of the MRRT.

 In 2013-14, net receipts from the MRRT are expected to be even lower, around
 $100 million, partly due to some companies claiming refunds from overpaid MRRT
 instalments from the previous year (this is down from $700 million forecast in the
 2013-14 Budget and 2013 PEFO). The 2014-15 Budget forecast of $100 million is less
 than 2 percent of the amount originally envisaged.

 The MRRT will be repealed from 1 July 2014.

Goods and services tax
Receipts from GST are forecast to grow by 5.0 percent in 2013-14 and 5.8 percent in
2014-15. Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, GST receipts excluding measures have been
revised up $750 million in 2013-14 and $4.5 billion over the four years to 2016-17 as a
result of stronger expected consumption growth.


Excise and customs duty
Excise and customs duty receipts are forecast to grow by 3.5 percent in 2013-14 and by
2.6 percent in 2014-15. Excluding measures, excise and customs duty receipts have
been revised down from the 2013-14 MYEFO by $600 million in 2013-14 and by
$2.7 billion over the four years to 2016-17. This is primarily a result of lower expected
clearances of tobacco and alcohol. New policy decisions, particularly fuel excise
indexation, have increased expected excise and customs duty receipts.


Carbon pricing mechanism
Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, there has been no revision to expected carbon tax receipts.
Carbon tax receipts are expected to be $7.2 billion in 2013-14 and $1.7 billion in
2014-15. The 2014-15 forecast carbon tax is a result of final acquittals of carbon tax
liabilities for 2013-14.


Other sales taxes
Other sales taxes include the wine equalisation tax (WET) and the luxury car tax (LCT).

Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, estimates of WET receipts are broadly unchanged and
expected to grow by 4.8 percent in 2013-14 and 2.6 percent in 2014-15.

LCT receipts are expected to decline by 1.0 percent in 2013-14 and 16.3 percent in
2014-15. Excluding measures, LCT receipts have been revised up $30 million in
2013-14, while over the four years to 2016-17 they are expected to decline by
$190 million since the 2013-14 MYEFO. This downward revision reflects lower
expected sales volumes and prices of motor vehicles subject to LCT.


Non-taxation receipts
Non-taxation receipts (including Future Fund earnings) are expected to decline by
11 percent in 2013-14 and grow by 16 percent in 2014-15. This largely relates to
proceeds from the sale of spectrum licences.

Non-taxation receipts have been revised up from the 2013-14 MYEFO by $403 million
in 2013-14 and $4.8 billion over the four years to 2016-17. This primarily reflects higher
forecasts of royalties and returns from unclaimed superannuation accounts in 2013-14
($455 million) and recognition of State and Territory contributions to the National
Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for the first time ($3.1 billion over the four years to
2016-17).

Revenue variations since the 2013-14 MYEFO
The revenue estimates are the accrual accounting equivalent of the cash-based receipts
estimates. Changes in revenue are generally driven by the same factors — policy as
well as parameter and other variations — as receipts. The timing of revenue and
receipts estimates may vary. Table 9 provides a reconciliation of the Budget’s revenue
estimates with those at the 2013-14 MYEFO.

Since the 2013-14 MYEFO, total revenue has been revised up around $300 million in
2013-14 and $10.8 billion over the four years to 2016-17. The factors affecting revisions
to tax receipts are also at play with regards to revenue.

The changes to individual revenue head accrual estimates since the 2013-14 MYEFO
are shown in Tables 10 and 11. For the five year accrual table, the accrual equivalent of
Table 8, see Budget Statement 9, Note 3.

Statement 5: Revenue


  APPENDIX A: REVENUE FORECASTING METHODOLOGY AND
                                  PERFORMANCE

The Government’s receipts estimates are generally prepared using a ‘base plus growth’
methodology. The last known outcome (2012-13 for the 2014-15 Budget) is used as the
base to which estimated growth rates are applied, resulting in receipts estimates for the
current and future years.

Most of the indirect heads of revenue, such as GST and fuel excise, are forecast by
mapping the growth rate of an appropriate economic parameter directly to the tax
growth rate in the relevant head of revenue. A number of income taxes also involve
determining whether this tax will be paid in the year the income is earned, such as for
pay-as-you-go withholding tax, or in future years, such as for individuals’ refunds.

The Government’s receipts forecasts, like all forecasts, are subject to a margin of error.
The receipts forecasts between 2002-03 and 2007-08 under-predicted outcomes
(Chart A1). For example, the 2007-08 Budget forecast taxation receipts to grow by
5.0 percent in 2007-08, while the outcome was growth of 8.1 percent, a forecast error
of 3.1 percentage points. Since 2008-09, the outcome for receipts has been lower than
the Budget forecast, broadly reflecting the effects of the GFC and subsequent weaker
than expected growth in wages and prices.

These historical forecasting errors form the basis of the confidence intervals for the
revenue forecasts presented in Appendix B of Statement 3.

Forecasting errors may be split into three underlying sources: errors in economic
forecasts that underpin the receipts forecasts; errors in translating the economy to

receipts forecasts; and miscellaneous factors such as post-Budget policy decisions,
court decisions regarding tax law interpretation, changes in compliance activities of
the ATO, and revisions to historical economic data. Note that there may also be
secondary errors relating to the timing of payments of tax — even if the underlying
forecasts were accurate, revenue may be recorded in the fiscal year before or after it
was expected.

The relative contribution of each of these sources of error varies from year to year, but
there is generally a strong correlation between the accuracy of the forecasts of the
nominal economy and the forecasts for tax receipts, as shown in Chart A2.

Source: Treasury.


Chart A2 plots the forecast errors for nominal GDP against the errors for tax receipts. It
shows where there has been an underestimate of nominal non-farm GDP growth, tax
receipts tend to be underestimated and vice versa.

Furthermore, on average, economic forecasting errors will be magnified in receipts
forecasting errors, due to the progressive nature of personal income tax. The lower and
upper lines are based on aggregate elasticities (of receipts with respect to nominal
non-farm GDP) of 1.0 and 1.5 respectively, assuming an error of plus or minus
0.5 percent if there is zero error on the economic forecasts. Forecasting errors outside
this range could be a result of factors such as timing of tax receipts

For example, in 2002-03, nominal non-farm GDP growth turned out to be around
1 percentage point higher than forecast, but growth in tax receipts (excluding CGT)
was almost 4 percentage points higher than forecast. That is, the error in the revenue
forecast was higher than the around 2 percentage points that the rule of thumb



                                                                     5-23
Statement 5: Revenue

suggests should be theoretically associated with an economic forecasting error of that
magnitude.

The forecast for 2013-14 tax receipts (excluding CGT) in the 2013-14 Budget is expected
to be an over estimate of around 3.9 percentage points, compared to an over estimate
of around 1.1 percentage points for nominal non-farm GDP growth. The forecasting
error is partly attributable to the shortfall in resource rent taxes. The resource rent tax
base is not expected to relate as closely to nominal GDP as taxes on wages or corporate
profits. The largest driver of the expected forecast error for 2013-14, however, is gross
income tax withholding (mostly withholding taxes on wages), which is estimated to be
nearly $7 billion (4.1 percent) short of the forecast in the 2013-14 Budget. This result,
caused by much lower than expected growth in average wages, comes after five years
of very accurate forecasts for gross income tax withholding (average error of
0.6 percent).

Discussions of earlier years can be found in previous budgets.

From 2008-09, forecasting errors in tax receipts have been significantly affected by the
economic downturn related to the GFC, particularly with regards to capital gains tax
(Chart A3).

Forecasting CGT is very difficult for several reasons. First, price movements above or
below the assumption may cause CGT to be significantly different from the forecast.
Secondly, CGT only applies to realised gains, so even if the asset prices are consistent
with the assumptions, there may be more or less gains realised than was assumed.
Thirdly, following the GFC, a large stock of capital losses were carried forward
(see Box 2 of Statement 5 of the 2010-11 Budget), and the utilisation of these losses
generates large uncertainty in both the timing and magnitude of the forecasts. Finally,
relevant data on CGT is available over a year after the event, meaning that the
forecasting assumptions will be slow to respond to changing taxpayer behaviour.

In light of concerns regarding the performance of economic and revenue forecasts, the
Secretary to the Treasury commissioned an independently overseen Review of Treasury
Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting, which made four recommendations in regard to
revenue forecasting (out of 11 recommendations in total). These four revenue-specific
recommendations were:

    developing a three sector company tax model (mining, financial and other);
•

    investigating whether further information can be drawn from the Australian
•
    Taxation Office’s liaison with large corporate taxpayers;

    constructing a micro-simulation model for forecasting personal income tax; and
•

    giving further consideration to the appropriate balance between the top-down
•
    versus bottom-up approaches to forecasting revenue.

These have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.

                       APPENDIX B: TAX EXPENDITURES
This appendix contains an overview of Australian Government tax expenditures, as
required by the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (CBHA).

The CBHA also requires the publication of an annual Tax Expenditures Statement (TES).
The 2013 TES was published in January 2014 and provides a detailed description of
Australian Government tax expenditures and, where possible, the estimated value or
order of magnitude of each tax expenditure.

A tax expenditure arises where a provision of the tax law causes a deviation from the
standard tax treatment that would apply to an activity or class of taxpayer: that is,
from the benchmark tax treatment.

    The choice of benchmark unavoidably involves judgment and may therefore be
•
    contentious in some cases. This choice should not be interpreted as indicating a
    view on how an activity or class of taxpayer ought to be taxed.

As noted in the 2013 TES, there is a particular question about the choice of benchmark
for savings. This is because most household saving is concentrated in property and
superannuation — both of which are taxed concessionally against the income tax
benchmark. Owner occupied housing is the largest form of savings held by Australian
households, and is taxed consistently with an expenditure tax benchmark. To help
facilitate discussion and understanding of the impact of utilising different benchmarks,
experimental estimates for superannuation using an expenditure tax benchmark were
reported in the 2013 TES.

The level of the tax expenditure estimates the difference in tax liabilities relative to the
benchmark. Consistent with most OECD countries, the standard methodology (the
‘revenue forgone’ approach) used to estimate tax expenditures is based on the existing
level of activity utilising a tax provision. These estimates therefore do not indicate the
revenue loss to the Australian Government budget of specific tax expenditures, as
there may be significant changes in activity were tax expenditures to be removed. Tax
expenditures estimated by the revenue gain approach do attempt to estimate these
losses, and several of these estimates are included in the 2013 TES.

Care needs to be taken when comparing tax expenditures with direct expenditures as
they may, for example, measure different things. In addition, estimates from different
editions of the TES should not be compared because benchmarks may have changed.

The information in Table B1 is derived from the 2013 TES and does not include the
impact of decisions in this Budget on tax expenditures. Further information on tax
expenditures is available in the 2013 TES.

       STATEMENT 6: EXPENSES AND NET CAPITAL
                    INVESTMENT


Statement 6 presents estimates of general government sector expenses and net
capital investment, allocated according to the various functions of government, on a
fiscal balance basis. These functions are based on an international standard
classification of functions of government that is incorporated into the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) reporting framework.

The first part of this statement provides information on trends in estimated
expenses while the second part presents trends in net capital investment estimates.
Estimates are on an Australian Government general government sector basis.

Statement 6 focuses on short to medium term trends in estimated expenses and
their underlying drivers. Consistent with this emphasis, much of Statement 6
explains year on year changes across the forward estimates period.
The main trends are:

    general government expenses as a percentage of GDP are forecast to decrease
•
    from 26.2 percent in 2013-14 to 25.4 percent in 2014-15, and then remain
    relatively stable over the forward estimates;

    in 2014-15 the social security and welfare, health, defence and education
•
    functions account for nearly two thirds of total expenses, with social security and
    welfare accounting for slightly more than one third of total expenses;

    in real terms, the strongest growth across the budget and forward estimates is
•
    expected to occur in the social security and welfare function; and

    net capital investment in 2014-15 largely reflects continued investment in
•
    defence capital projects.

OVERVIEW
Australian Government general government sector (GGS) accrual expenses are
expected to decrease by 2.3 percent in real terms in 2014-15, with the growth rate
increasing to 2016-17 before decreasing in 2017-18. Total expenses are expected to
decline as a percentage of GDP from 26.2 percent in 2013-14 to 25.4 percent in 2014-15,
and then remain relatively stable over the forward estimates.

The Government has made policy decisions which reduce expenses by $15.1 billion
over the four years from 2013-14 to 2016-17 compared to the 2013-14 MYEFO, while
programme specific parameter variations have increased expenses by $2.3 billion over
the same period. Economic parameter variations are expected to increase expenses by
$4.4 billion over the four years from 2013-14 to 2016-17 compared to the
2013-14 MYEFO. Public debt interest is estimated to decrease by $1.7 billion compared
to the 2013-14 MYEFO.

Major expense trends between 2013-14 and 2014-15, and from 2014-15 over the forward
years include movements in the following functions:

    general public services — the decrease in expenses between 2013-14 and 2014-15 is
•
    primarily due to a one-off grant provided to the Reserve Bank of Australia. The
    grant took the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund to 15 percent of assets at risk, which
    ensures the bank has all of the resources available to operate in a volatile
    environment. In the normal course of events, the bank would be profitable,
    enabling the Government to receive future dividends. From 2014-15 to 2017-18
    expenses in the general public services function are estimated to remain relatively
    stable;

    defence — the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 reflects the
•
    Government’s commitment to recapitalise Defence and put its funding back on an
    achievable and realistic growth path towards 2 percent as a share of GDP by
    2023-24. The increase is partially offset by the Government shifting funding within
    the Defence budget away from expenses in favour of capital expenditure, to
    improve defence capability;

    education — the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 largely reflects the
•
    Government’s Students First school education policy. Further information on
    Students First can be found in Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures and the Mid-Year
    Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2013-14;



                                          6-7
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

    health — the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 is driven by a range of
•
    programmes within the Medical Services and Benefits, Pharmaceutical Benefits and
    Services and Assistance to the States for public hospitals sub-functions. Higher
    demand for health services, and a growing and ageing population, continue to be
    significant drivers of increasing health costs;

    social security and welfare — the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 are
•
    largely due to an ageing population with more people accessing age, disability and
    carer payments and residential and home care together with implementation of the
    National Disability Insurance Scheme to support people with a significant and
    permanent disability;

    housing and community amenities — the decrease in expenses between 2013-14
•
    and 2014-15 is primarily due to the termination of various programmes as part of
    the abolition of the carbon tax, including the Jobs and Competitiveness Programme,
    Energy Security Fund and the Biodiversity Fund;

    transport and communication — the fluctuating profile of expenses from 2014-15
•
    to 2017-18 are largely driven by infrastructure projects within the Rail Transport
    and Road Transport sub-functions where the value of projects funded varies year
    on year, and payments correspond to project timelines; and

    other purposes — the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 primarily
•
    reflects growing general revenue assistance payments (largely GST) to be made to
    the States and Territories, increasing public debt interest costs and the conservative
    bias allowance component of the Contingency Reserve.

Government expenses are strongly influenced by underlying trends in spending in the
social security and welfare, health and education functions (see Boxes 1 and 2).
Together, these functions account for 58.4 percent of all government expenses in
2014-15. Further details of spending trends against all functions including movements
in expenses from 2013-14 to 2014-15 are set out under individual function headings.

Box 1: Where does government spending go in 2014-15?

Government spending provides a wide range of services to the community. The most
significant component of government spending relates to social security and welfare,
with around one third of total expenses providing support to the aged, families with
children, people with disabilities, veterans, carers and unemployed people.

Another one sixth of government expenses occur in health, including Medicare
Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) payments. A
similar amount is also transferred to the States and Territories in general revenue
assistance under the other purposes function.

The Government also provides significant investment under the education function,
supporting government and non-government schools, as well as higher education and
vocational education and training. The remainder is spent on defence and a range of
other public services.

The estimates presented in the chart above are explained in greater detail under each
individual function in the following pages.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment


Box 2: Trends in future spending

Social security and welfare expenses are projected to grow strongly over the forward
estimates. Key factors driving this include age, disability and carer payments and an
increase in expenses associated with home care, home support, and residential and
flexible aged care programmes, with demographic factors resulting in an increase in
the number of people receiving these payments. Another driver of growth is the
implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

A number of major health programmes will continue to see expenditure growth,
including the MBS, the Private Health Insurance Rebate, and payments to the States
and Territories for public hospital services. Spending on health is influenced by
population growth and to some extent by the ageing of the population together with
developments in health technology and the resulting use of new products and
services.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

General government sector expenses
General public services
The general public services function includes expenses to support the organisation and
operation of government such as those related to the Parliament, the Governor-General
and conduct of elections; the collection of taxes and management of public funds and
debt; assistance to developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable
development, particularly countries in the Pacific region; contributions to international
organisations; and the operations of the foreign service. It also includes expenses
related to research in areas not otherwise connected with a specific function, and those
associated with overall economic and statistical services as well as government
superannuation benefits (excluding nominal interest expenses on unfunded liabilities
which are included under the nominal superannuation interest sub-function in the
other purposes function).

Total general public services expenses are estimated to decrease by 33.6 percent in real
terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and decrease by 7.7 percent in real terms over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

The uneven profile of expenses under the legislative and executive affairs
sub-function partly reflects costs that will be incurred by the Australian Electoral
Commission to support the scheduled federal election in 2016-17 and costs incurred by
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet due to Australia hosting the Group
of 20 in 2014.

Expenses in the financial and fiscal affairs sub-function are expected to decrease from
2013-14 to 2014-15, primarily due to a one-off grant provided to the Reserve Bank of
Australia. Over the forward estimates, bad and doubtful debts expenses are expected
to increase in line with the normal growth in taxation revenue over the forward
estimates.

The fall in expenses from 2013-14 to 2014-15 in the government superannuation
benefits sub-function reflects the use of different discount rates. The superannuation
expenses for 2013-14 apply a discount rate based on long-term government bonds at
the commencement of the financial year (4.3 percent) in accordance with accounting

(a) The difference between these figures and the Government’s ODA budget is partly due to the way
     replenishments are recognised in accrual terms when initial commitments are made. However,
     international reporting of ODA is in cash terms and reflects the timing of actual cash payments (which, in
     the case of multilateral replenishments, can be spread over several years).
(b) Some ODA delivered by other government departments is also classified to other programmes or
     functions.
(c) Programme Support includes departmental expenses of administering ODA for the Department of
     Foreign Affairs and Trade.
(d) Diplomacy includes Departmental expenditure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s
     Operations, Security and IT, overseas property and international climate change engagement.

 Box 3: Official Development Assistance

 The Government will maintain official development assistance (ODA) spending at
 its nominal 2013-14 level of $5.0 billion in each of 2014-15 and 2015-16. From 2016-17
 ODA will grow in line with the Consumer Price Index.

 ODA spending reported internationally differs from the reporting in Table 4.1 due
 to some ODA eligible activities of government departments outside of the Foreign
 Affairs Portfolio being reported in other functions, and due to accounting
 differences in the treatment of investments and loans and reflects the timing of
 actual cash payments.


Total expenses under the foreign affairs and economic aid sub-function are expected
to increase by 1.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and are forecast to
decrease by 0.7 percent in real terms across the forward years from 2014-15.

This decrease is due to the Government’s decision to maintain official development
assistance (ODA) expenditure at 2013-14 levels to 2015-16 with funding to grow in line
with Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2016-17 onwards. Budget Paper No. 2, Budget
Measures 2014-15, contains further details on the Government’s revision to the growth
profile for ODA (see Box 3).

The general research sub-function incorporates expenses incurred by the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), the Australian
Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Australian Research Council (ARC).

Total expenses under this sub-function are expected to decrease in real terms by
4.8 percent from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 16.4 percent across the forward estimates
from 2014-15. This decrease is driven by the completion of a number of one-off projects
funded under the Education Investment Fund, and the measure Science and Research
Agencies — reduced funding.

The table below sets out the major components of general research sub-function
expenses.

Defence
The defence function includes expenses incurred by the Department of Defence
(Defence), the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) and related agencies. Defence
expenses support Australian military operations overseas and the delivery of navy,
army, air and intelligence capabilities and strategic policy advice in the defence of
Australia and its national interests. The DMO contributes to the preparedness of the
Australian defence organisation through the acquisition and through-life support of
military equipment and supplies.

This function records the majority of expenses incurred by the defence portfolio but
does not include the expenses incurred by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs,
superannuation payments to retired military personnel and housing assistance
provided through Defence Housing Australia. These expenses are reported in the
social security and welfare, other purposes, and housing and community amenities
functions, respectively.

Total expenses for the defence function are estimated to increase by 3.7 percent in real
terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and increase by 6.1 percent in real terms over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18. While the increase in expenses from 2014-15 to 2017-18 in
part reflects new policy decisions which provide defence additional funding, this is
partially offset by a shift in funding within the Defence budget away from expenses in
favour of capital expenditure, to improve defence capability (see Box 4 showing
expenses and net capital investment).

To this end, the Government will achieve savings of $1.2 billion over four years
through various initiatives to increase efficiency and reduce spending in lower priority
areas. The savings will be re-invested in capital to support Defence capability.

The funding growth does not include the full cost of operations beyond 2014-15 as
such funding is considered on a year-by-year basis and is subject to future
Government decisions. In 2014-15, additional funding of $194.0 million will be
provided to support Defence operations in the Middle East and in protecting
Australia’s borders.

Box 4: Defence funding

Total Defence spending is estimated to increase by $4.0 billion (or 6.4 percent in real
terms) between 2014-15 and 2017-18. This includes both expenses and net capital
investment. Expenses for the defence function are those incurred in undertaking
day-to-day activities. Net capital investment represents expenditure to acquire
capital items in the form of equipment, buildings and land, less depreciation
expenses.

Capital funding in the defence function is applied towards the acquisition of
military equipment, enabling services and the construction of support facilities
linked to capability. Fluctuations in capital spending can be due to slippage in
expenditure from one year to the next year, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and
additional funding decisions of Government.

Public order and safety
The public order and safety function includes expenses to support the administration
of the federal legal system and the provision of legal services, including legal aid, to
the community. Public order and safety expenses also include law enforcement and
intelligence activities, and the protection of Australian Government property.

Total expenses for the public order and safety function are estimated to decrease by
3.4 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and by 14.3 percent in real terms
over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Expenses within the courts and legal services sub-function are expected to decrease
by 21.5 percent in real terms from 2014-15 over the forward years, and by 5.5 percent
in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15. This is largely due to the expected completion of
the three established Royal Commissions over the next three years.

Expenses within the other public order and safety sub-function are expected to
decrease by 12.1 percent in real terms from 2014-15 over the forward years, and by
2.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15. This is largely due to the cessation of
a number of temporary measures as well as recent efficiency measures which have
reduced departmental resourcing. Further information is contained in the measures
Australian Federal Police officers — cessation of recruitment and Australian Federal Police —
savings from efficiencies (see Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15). This impact
has been partially offset by additional funding provided to the Australian Customs
and Border Protection Service to reform border protection services.

The education function includes expenses to support the delivery of education services
through higher education institutions; vocational education and training providers

Expenses under the higher education sub-function are expected to increase by
0.6 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and decrease by 4.7 percent in real
terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The increase in expenses from 2013-14 to 2014-15 is due
to growth in projected enrolments. The expected decrease from 2014-15 is mainly due
to the implementation of the Expanding opportunity — expansion of the demand driven
system and sharing the cost fairly measure from 2016, which allows higher education

providers to set their own course fees and a reduction in subsidies provided under the
Commonwealth Grant Scheme.

Expenses under the vocational and other education sub-function are estimated to
increase by 1.1 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15, and decrease by
22.9 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The forecast decline in expenses
over the forward estimates is due to the conclusion of funding under the Skills Reform
National Partnership Agreement in 2016-17.

Aggregate school funding expenses are expected to increase by 3.7 percent in real
terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and by 17.3 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to
2017-18 reflecting the Government’s Students First school education policy. Slower
growth in 2017-18 reflects the Government’s commitment to put school funding on a
more sustainable footing. From 2018, school funding will be indexed by the Consumer
Price Index, with an allowance for changes in enrolments, to maintain the real level of
Australian Government school funding.

Expenses in the schools — non-government schools sub-function are expected to
increase by 3.4 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and by 13.1 percent
in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. Expenses under the schools — government
schools sub-function are expected to increase by 4.2 percent in real terms between
2013-14 and 2014-15 and by 24.8 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Expenses under the student assistance sub-function are expected to decrease by
18.3 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and by 4.5 percent in real terms
from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The decrease in 2014-15 is primarily due to recent changes in
tertiary student assistance including the removal of grandfathering of recipients of the
Student Start-up Scholarship from 1 July 2015.

Expenses under the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) mainly reflect the
estimated cost to the Government of providing concessional loans. These expenses are
recorded when loans are issued and are based on projections of future interest rates.
These expenses are expected to reduce in 2014-15 and be removed from 2015-16
onwards as a result of the Government’s decision to change the indexation
arrangements for debts from the Consumer Price Index to a rate equivalent to the
yields on 10 year Australian Government bonds from 1 June 2016. The remaining
expenses relate to the write down of debts.

Health
The health function includes expenses relating to medical services funded through
Medicare and the Private Health Insurance Rebate; payments to the States and
Territories to deliver essential health services, including public hospitals; the
Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes; Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander health programmes; Mental Health services; and health
workforce initiatives.

In addition to these expenses, the Government is creating a Medical Research Future
Fund (MRFF) from 1 January 2015 to provide a sustainable and growing funding
stream to be invested in additional medical research in the medium to long term.

(a) The name of this sub-function has changed from the           ‘National Health Reform Payment’ to the
    ‘Assistance to the States for public hospitals’.
(b) The hospital services sub-function includes payments from the Commonwealth to the States and
    Territories for specific hospital improvement initiatives and is in addition to the bulk of hospital funding
    provided under the former National Health Reform Payment sub-function (now called the ‘Assistance to
    the States for public hospitals’ sub-function).


Total expenses for this function are estimated to increase by 1.5 percent in real terms
between 2013-14 and 2014-15. Total expenses are estimated to increase by 3.9 percent
in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. This expected growth is driven by higher
demand for health services, and a growing and ageing population.

The medical services and benefits sub-function, which primarily consists of Medicare
and Private Health Insurance Rebate (PHIR) expenses, is 42.2 percent of total
estimated health expenses for 2014-15. Medicare expenses are the major driver of
growth in this sub-function. Expenses for Medicare are expected to increase by
2.8 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15. The fall in expenses of
3.1 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2015-16 largely reflects the impact of the
Government’s decisions to strengthen and improve the sustainability of Medicare.
Expenses are still expected to grow by 3.5 percent in real terms over the period
2014-15 to 2017-18, as a result of ongoing growth in the use of medical services and in
the use of high value items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

Expenses for PHIR are expected to increase by 2.8 percent in real terms between
2013-14 and 2014-15, and are expected to grow by 5.9 percent in real terms over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18 due to forecast continued take up of private health insurance
policies. The proportion of Australians with some form of private health insurance is
now around 55 percent, providing a high level of access to private health services and
taking pressure off the public system.

Expenses for dental services are expected to grow by 3.0 percent in real terms over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18, due to the expansion of dental services in the public dental
system. Expenses for this activity had not previously been identified separately, but
were included in the Medicare Services component of this sub-function.

     been separately identified.


The pharmaceutical benefits and services sub-function is expected to decrease by
1.9 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 due largely to the current price
disclosure policy which requires manufacturers to disclose to the Government the
actual price at which they sell medicines to wholesalers and pharmacies. Expenses are
expected to grow by 2.1 percent in real terms over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.
Estimates for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) do not include the potential
listing of new drugs or price adjustments to existing drugs, which typically increase
spending above original estimates.

The major components of the pharmaceutical benefits and services sub-function are set
out in Table 8.2.

The Australian Government’s contribution to public hospital funding is reported
through the Assistance to the States for public hospitals sub-function. Hospital
services covered by this sub-function include all admitted services, programmes that
deliver hospital services in the home and emergency department services. The increase
in expenses of 6.8 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 reflects the
Commonwealth’s commitment to provide additional hospital funding from 2014-15
under current agreements with the States. The increase in expenses of 14.0 percent in
real terms over the period 2014-15 to 2016-17 largely reflects growth in the volume of
services and changes in the efficient price of those services. The rate of growth in the
expenses slows to around 1.8 percent in real terms between 2016-17 and 2017-18 due
to the Government’s decision to put hospital funding on a more sustainable footing
and to index hospital funding from 1 July 2017 by a combination of population growth
and the Consumer Price Index.

The hospital services sub-function includes payments to the States and Territories
through a range of National Partnership Agreements, and support for veterans’
hospital services. Expenditure growth for this sub-function is expected to fall by 32.9
percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15, and fall by 18.8 percent in real
terms over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18. This significant fall is primarily due to the
conclusion of elements of the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public
Hospital Services at the end of 2013-14, and the cessation of reward funding from
1 July 2015.

Expenses in the health services sub-function include Australian Government expenses
associated with the delivery of population health, mental health, hearing services,
blood and blood products, research and other allied health services, and health

infrastructure funding through the Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF), which will
cease operation on 31 December 2014, with uncommitted funds being transferred to
the Medical Research Future Fund. From 2013-14 to 2014-15 expenditure is expected to
increase by 1.7 percent in real terms, and between 2014-15 and 2017-18 expenditure is
expected to decrease by 8.0 percent in real terms. This largely reflects projects funded
from the HHF nearing completion. The reduction in Health Infrastructure is partially
offset by increased expenditure on the national blood agreement, reflecting both
greater costs and demand for blood products, and the expenditure of earnings from
the Medical Research Future Fund to support research.

The major components of the health services sub-function are set out in Table 8.3.

The general administration — health sub-function includes the Government’s
investment in health workforce measures and support for rural health initiatives.
Expenditure for this sub-function is expected to fall in real terms by 3.9 percent
between 2013-14 and 2014-15, and to fall in real terms by 4.6 percent over the period
2014-15 to 2017-18. This is a result of the recent measures the Government has
undertaken to minimise the growth in programme delivery costs such as improving
the efficiency of health workforce development and rebuilding general practice
education and training.

Expenses in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health sub-function is expected
to decrease by 10.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, largely due to
efficiencies in Indigenous health programme funding. Expenses are expected to
increase by 15.5 percent in real terms over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18 as Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia continue to access
Indigenous-specific services. Substantial investments in Indigenous health also occur
through other health sub-functions.

Box 5: Medical Research Future Fund

In addition to expenditure on the health function, the Government will create a
Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) from 1 January 2015 to provide a sustainable
and growing funding stream to be spent on further medical research in the medium
to long term. All savings from health expenditure which have been announced in
the 2014-15 Budget and the current uncommitted balance of the Health and
Hospitals Fund (HHF) will be reinvested in the MRFF until its balance reaches
$20 billion, which is estimated to occur in 2019-20. The capital and any ongoing
capital gains of the MRFF will be preserved in perpetuity.

The net interest earnings of the fund will be drawn down in the year after they are
earned and used to fund critical medical research. This additional expenditure will
grow from $20 million in 2015-16 to provide an ongoing funding stream of around
$1 billion per year from 2022-23.

Social security and welfare
The social security and welfare function includes expenses for pensions and services to
the aged; assistance to the unemployed, people with disabilities and families with
children; and income support and compensation for veterans and their dependants. It
also includes assistance provided to Indigenous Australians which has not been
included under other functions.

Expenses in the social security and welfare function are estimated to grow by
1.5 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 8.1 percent in real terms from
2014-15 to 2017-18.

The sub-functions contributing most to the growth are assistance to the aged, at
8.5 percent and assistance to people with disabilities at 42.5 percent in real terms over
the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

The principal driver of growth over the forward estimates for the assistance to the
aged sub-function is income support for seniors (Age Pension), which is estimated to
grow by 4.2 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and 9.6 percent in real terms
from 2014-15 to 2017-18 due to demographic changes. Real growth in expenses is
expected to slow to 2.2 percent from 2016-17 to 2017-18 due to the impact of 2014-15
Budget measures including changes to indexation and deeming arrangements, which
take effect in 2017-18.

Also contributing to growth from 2014-15 to 2017-18 is an increase in expenses
associated with home care, home support and residential and flexible aged care
programmes, largely reflecting demographic factors.

The reduction in National Partnership Payments — Assistance to the Aged from
2014-15 to 2017-18 reflects the expiry of National Partnership Agreements with
Western Australia and Victoria on 30 June 2015. All other States and Territories
transferred funding and policy responsibility for aged care to the Australian
Government from 1 July 2012, with this funding now included in the Home Support

Programme. Victoria has now also agreed to transfer these responsibilities, with
arrangements still under negotiation.

The estimated increase in the cost of veterans’ community care and support over the
forward estimates is mainly attributable to a growing number of veterans and war
widow(ers) accessing residential aged care.

Table 9.1.

Expenses for the assistance to veterans and dependants sub-function are estimated to
fall over the forward estimates, predominantly reflecting an expected natural decline
in the number of beneficiaries.

The increase in projected expenses in the assistance to people with disabilities
sub-function from 2013-14 across the forward estimates is primarily driven by the
National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).

Expenses for the NDIS are estimated to grow substantially in real terms across the
forward estimates, reflecting the increase in numbers of people with disabilities
entering the scheme as it moves towards full coverage across all jurisdictions. Of the
total $17.4 billion in expenses over the forward estimates, the Commonwealth is
contributing funding of $8.4 billion ($408 million in 2014-15, $614 million in 2015-16,
$2.1 billion in 2016-17 and $5.2 billion in 2017-18), with the remainder contributed by
the States and Territories. Information on State and Territory contributions to the NDIS
and related expenses is provided in Statement 3 of Budget Paper No. 1.




                                             6-27
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

Expenses for the Disability Support Pension (DSP) are estimated to grow by
2.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and 1.7 percent in real terms from
2014-15 to 2017-18 due to increases in payment rates. Growth is expected to slow from
2017-18 due to changes to indexation arrangements that take effect from that year. The
use of DSP impairment tables underpins low growth in DSP recipient numbers, with
an estimated average growth of 0.25 percent per annum over the forward estimates.

Expenses for income support for carers are estimated to grow by 6.9 percent in real
terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and 18.9 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18,
largely as a result of growth in Carer Payment and Carer Allowance (adult) payments
predominantly driven by the increasing number of frail aged Australians receiving
care at home.

outlined below in Table 9.2.

The main components of the assistance to families with children sub-function are
family tax benefit payments, child care fee assistance, income support to parents and
paid parental leave.

Growth in child care fee assistance expenses is being driven by increases in child care
costs flowing through to increased payments under the Child Care Rebate and the
growing number of families accessing fee assistance for child care, including the Child
Care Benefit. These factors are estimated to result in growth in child care fee assistance
expenses of 9.9 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and 18.5 percent in real
terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Family Tax Benefit (FTB) expenses are estimated to decline by 6.3 percent in real terms
from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 18.7 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

                                                Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

Reductions from 2014-15 reflect the impact of the 2014-15 Budget measures to improve
the targeting and sustainability of FTB payments.

The Baby Bonus payment closed on 1 March 2014 resulting in a reduction in expenses
between 2013-14 and 2014-15 in the current Paid Parental Leave programme, formerly
part of the Parent and Baby Payments programme. A provision has been made for the
new Paid Parental Leave Scheme in the Contingency Reserve.

Expenses for the assistance to the unemployed and the sick sub-function are
estimated to decrease by 2.2 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and
decrease by 3.7 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The decrease to
expenses is mainly due to government decisions in the 2014-15 Budget including
stronger participation incentives for job seekers under 30 and an increase in the age of
eligibility for Newstart Allowance from 22 to 25.

Expenses for the assistance for Indigenous Australians not elsewhere classified (nec)
sub-function are estimated to increase by 10.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to
2014-15. This increase in expenses from 2013-14 to 2014-15 reflects the Government’s
commitment to bring together Indigenous programmes with a focus on achieving
improved education, employment and community safety outcomes for Indigenous
Australians. This has resulted in activities previously identified under other


                                                 6-29
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

sub-functions being reclassified under the assistance for Indigenous Australians (nec)
sub-function. This includes expenses under the Indigenous Employment Programme
and the Remote Jobs and Communities Programme, which were previously classified
under the labour market assistance to job seekers and industry sub-function, and also
the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Programme, which was previously
classified under the schools — non-government schools and schools — government
schools sub-functions.

From 2014-15 to 2017-18 funding remains relatively constant in nominal terms, but
declines in real terms as a result of efficiencies achieved through programme
consolidation.

Expenses for the general administration sub-function are estimated to increase
slightly in 2014-15, and then decrease over the period 2015-16 to 2017-18 due mainly to
administrative efficiencies generated within the Department of Human Services.

Housing and community amenities
The housing and community amenities function includes expenses for the Australian
Government’s contribution to the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose
Payments and related National Partnerships, other Australian Government housing
programmes, the expenses of Defence Housing Australia (DHA), and various regional
development and environmental protection programmes.

Total housing and community amenities         8,383      4,835   4,902     5,026      5,105


Total expenses under the housing and community amenities function are estimated to
decrease by 43.6 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 due to a decrease in
expenses in the environment protection sub-function, and to decrease further by
1.9 percent in real terms over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

The housing sub-function contains initiatives relating to the Australian Government’s
contribution to the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment and related
National Partnerships, provision of housing for the general public and people with
special needs.

Expenses for this sub-function are estimated to decrease by 3.7 percent in real terms
from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and then increase by 0.6 percent in real terms over the period
to 2014-15 to 2017-18. Housing expenses are estimated to decline in real terms in
2015-16, before increasing from 2016-17, reflecting a re-profiling both of the National
Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing which brings expenses
forward due to accelerated rates of construction and refurbishments, and of the
National Rental Affordability Scheme which shifts expenses to later years, due to later
than expected delivery dates of affordable rental dwellings.

The urban and regional development sub-function comprises regional development
programmes and services to territories, including the Community Development
Grants programme and the new National Stronger Regions Fund which will fund
capital works projects in local communities. Expenses are expected to fluctuate over
the forward estimates, consistent with the varying nature of the projects undertaken
with payments to correspond to project milestones. Expenses are expected to peak in
2015-16 coinciding with the commencement of the National Stronger Regions Fund
and significant estimated expenditure in the Community Development Grants
programme.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

The environment protection sub-function includes expenses for a variety of initiatives,
including the protection and conservation of the environment, water and waste
management, pollution abatement and environmental research. The decrease in
expenses from 2013-14 to 2014-15 is primarily due to the termination of various
programmes as part of the abolition of the carbon tax, including the Jobs and
Competitiveness Programme, Energy Security Fund and the Biodiversity Fund. The
increase in expenses after 2014-15 is primarily due to the implementation of the
Emissions Reduction Fund.

Recreation and culture
The recreation and culture function includes expenses to support public broadcasting
and cultural institutions, funding for the arts and the film industry, assistance to sport
and recreation activities, as well as the management and protection of national parks
and other world heritage areas. This function also includes expenses relating to the
protection and preservation of historic sites and buildings, including war graves.

Total expenses under the recreation and culture function are estimated to decrease by
7.7 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 11.6 percent in real terms
over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Expenses under the broadcasting sub-function are expected to fall by 4.8 percent in
real terms from 2014-15 through to 2017-18, primarily due to several 2013-14 Budget
measures relating to the national broadcasters, such as the ABC — Continuation of
Enhanced News Services measure, which terminate in 2015-16.

Expenses under the arts and cultural heritage sub-function are estimated to decrease
by 3.2 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 15.0 percent over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18. This sub-function includes programmes which support
funding for the arts and cultural institutions. The estimated decreases are due to the



                                            6-33
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

implementation of greater efficiencies, and arts-related savings measures, including
the reduction from 2014-15 of uncommitted arts programme grants, as well as the
cessation of measures from the 2011-12 Budget: Enhancements from the review of the
Australian independent screen production sector and the Contemporary music touring
programme; and the 2012-13 Budget: Australian National Academy of Music — increased
funding and Boosting music industry innovation and exports.

Expenses under the sport and recreation sub-function are estimated to decrease by
32.3 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 which primarily reflects a return to
normal spending following the Government’s one-off contribution to the Queensland
Government in 2013-14 for permanent infrastructure for the 2018 Gold Coast
Commonwealth Games. The completion of preparatory work on the Asian Football
Cup and the termination of the 2014-15 Budget measures Sporting Schools Initiative on
30 June 2017 are the main reasons for the estimated decrease in expenses of 28.8 per
cent in real terms over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Expenses under the national estate and parks sub-function are estimated to decrease
by 12.1 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 11.0 percent in real terms
over the period 2014-15 to 2017-18. The decrease from 2013-14 largely reflects a
reduction in expenses for the Australian Antarctic Programme. The decline is partly a
result of the completion of the initial life-extension works on the Aurora Australis, the
multi-purpose icebreaking vessel which supports Australia’s activities in Antarctica, in
2013-14 and the progressive completion of work on the procurement process for a new
icebreaker. The further decline in expenses in 2015-16 relates, in part, to the scheduled
termination of one component of the measure Antarctica — maintaining Australia’s
presence.

Fuel and energy
The fuel and energy function includes expenses for the Fuel Tax Credits, Cleaner Fuels,
and Product Stewardship Waste (Oil) schemes, all administered by the Australian
Taxation Office. It also includes expenses related to improving Australia’s energy
efficiency, resource related initiatives, and programmes to support the production or
use of alternative fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel.

Fuel and energy expenses are estimated to decrease by 2.0 percent in real terms from
2013-14 to 2014-15, and increase by 3.1 percent in real terms over the period 2014-15 to
2017-18.

The major programme within this function is the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme which is
expected to increase by 5.4 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and increase
by 12.8 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. This reflects the Government’s
decision to index fuel excise duties on diesel, petrol and other fuel products by the
Consumer Price Index, and expected increases in claims by eligible businesses
commensurate with higher diesel consumption, particularly in the mining industry.

The reduction in expenses under the resources related initiatives and management
component from 2014-15 to 2017-18 reflects the Government’s decision to reduce
funding for the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships programme and to abolish the
Ethanol Production Grants programme on 30 June 2015.

The reduction in expenses under the energy related initiatives and management
component from 2013-14 to 2014-15 is due to the termination of the Coal Sector Jobs
package on 30 June 2014 (as part of the repeal of the carbon tax and associated
measures), and the Government’s decision to abolish the Australian Renewable Energy
Agency (ARENA). The management of existing ARENA projects will be transferred to
the Department of Industry. The fluctuation in expenses under this component from
2014-15 to 2017-18 is driven by the timing of project milestones for the existing ARENA
projects.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing
The agriculture, forestry and fishing function includes expenses to support assistance
to primary producers, forestry, fishing, land and water resources management,
quarantine services and contributions to research and development.

Total expenses under this function are estimated to increase by 2.4 percent in real
terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, but decrease by 13.4 percent in real terms over the
period 2014-15 to 2017-18.

The decrease from 2014-15 is partly due to an estimated reduction in expenses within
the rural assistance sub-function. Expenses under this sub-function are estimated to
decrease by 41.2 percent in real terms between 2014-15 and 2017-18, primarily due to
the funding profile of the Carbon Farming Futures programme declining over the
forward estimates. This is partially offset by an expected increase in expenses under
the Farm Household Allowance due to unfavourable seasonal conditions in affected parts
of Australia with a consequent forecast increase in assistance to be provided.

The majority of expenses under the natural resources development sub-function are
related to water initiatives, comprising urban and rural programmes, including
irrigation modernisation, recycling and stormwater capture. Funding for water
purchasing is included under net capital investment. The increase in expenses under
the water reform component from 2013-14 largely reflects the continuation of projects
under the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Programme, peaking in
2015-16. The decrease in expenses from 2013-14 under the Other component reflects
the progressive completion of projects under the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s
Environmental Works and Measures programme. The reduction in expenses from
2016-17 to 2017-18 primarily relates to the currently scheduled termination of funding
for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s basin planning functions.

Mining, manufacturing and construction
The mining, manufacturing and construction function includes expenses for
programmes designed to promote the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian
industries. The major components include the research and development tax incentive
and programmes specific to the automotive, textile, clothing and footwear industries.


Table 14: Summary of expenses — mining, manufacturing and construction
                                                 Estimates                   Projections

Total expenses under the mining, manufacturing and construction function are
expected to decrease by 14.6 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by
15.1 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

The decrease in expenses in 2014-15 for the Research and Development Tax Incentive,
administered by the Australian Taxation Office, partially reflects the $70 million a year
estimate of the Government’s decision to reduce the refundable tax offset by 1.5
percentage points from 45.0 percent to 43.5 percent, effective from 1 July 2014, for
expenditure on eligible research and development activities. The increase from 2015-16
reflects an increase in the number and size of expected claims.

Expenses under the industry development and investment component of this function
are expected to decrease due to the Government’s decision to refocus industry policy
by terminating a range of industry and innovation programmes and establishing the
Entrepreneurs’ Infrastructure Programme. The decrease in expenses also reflects the
Government’s decision to terminate the Automotive Transformation Scheme from
1 January 2018 and not proceed with funding for the General Motors Holden next
generation vehicles project.

Total expenses under this function are estimated to decrease by 16.1 percent in real
terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15, and decrease by 4.8 percent in real terms from
2014-15 to 2017-18.

The estimated expenses for the communication sub-function relate to communication
activities and support for the digital economy through the Department of
Communications and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Total
expenses under the communication sub-function are estimated to decrease by
9.8 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and decrease by 20.6 percent in
real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. These decreases primarily reflect the completion of
several digital productivity measures and the planned completion of activities related
to the sale of radio frequency spectrum.

Total expenses under the rail transport sub-function are estimated to decrease by
42.2 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and then decrease sharply each year
thereafter (a decrease of 68.7 percent from 2014-15 to 2017-18) reflecting the
completion of projects announced in the 2009-10 Budget.

The estimated expenses for the air transport and sea transport sub-functions
predominantly relate to activities of the safety regulators — the Civil Aviation Safety
Authority, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian Transport
Safety Bureau (ATSB). Total expenses under the air transport sub-functions are
estimated to increase by 1.1 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and
decrease by 5.8 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18 primarily due to the
completion of airstrip improvements under the Regional Aviation Access programme
by mid-2015. Total expenses under the sea transport sub-function are estimated to
decrease by 5.2 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and increase in real
terms by 0.8 percent from 2014-15 to 2017-18 due to the expansion of the ATSB’s safety
investigation responsibilities under the National Transport Reforms.

                                          Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

The expenses under the road transport sub-function primarily consist of grants
provided under the Infrastructure Investment Programme. Expenses are estimated to
decrease by 12.3 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and increase by
11.6 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The increase in expenses over the
forward years is largely driven by additional funding for the Infrastructure Growth
Package announced in the 2014-15 Budget, in addition to the measures announced at
the 2013-14 MYEFO. Measures under the Infrastructure Growth Package include the
Infrastructure Growth Package — Asset Recycling Fund, Infrastructure Growth Package —
Asset Recycling Initiative — establishment, Infrastructure Growth Package — addition to the
Infrastructure Investment Programme for new investments, Infrastructure Growth Package —
Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan — Road funding, Infrastructure Growth Package —
Western Sydney Infrastructure Unit — establishment and the Infrastructure Growth
Package — WestConnex Stage 2 — provision of a concessional loan. Projects to be funded
under these measures include WestConnex in New South Wales, the East-West Link in
Victoria, priority roads around the Badgerys Creek future airport site in Western
Sydney, the North South Road in South Australia, the Perth Freight Link in Western
Australia and the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing in Queensland. Expense
estimates for this sub function fluctuate year on year based on the number and value of
projects funded, with payments corresponding to project timelines.

Total expenses under the other transport and communication sub-function are
estimated to increase by 22.4 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as
part of Australia’s contribution to the costs of the search for Malaysia Airlines flight
MH370 and decrease by 35.4 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. This
sub-function primarily reflects departmental funding for the Department of
Infrastructure and Regional Development and is decreasing in real terms over the
forward estimates as a result of the expected reduction in activities in relation to
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the cessation of the Indonesian Transport Safety
Assistance Package.

labour market assistance, immigration, industrial relations and other economic affairs
not elsewhere classified (nec).

Total expenses under the other economic affairs function are expected to decrease by
7.3 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 17.4 percent in real terms
from 2014-15 to 2017-18.

Tourism and area promotion sub-function expenses are expected to decrease from
2014-15 due to the finalisation of several tourism related initiatives, including the
T-QUAL Grants programme component of the Programmes to promote Australia’s
Tourism interest programme.

Expenses under the vocational and industry training sub-function are expected to
decrease in real terms by 16.9 percent from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and by 4.3 percent from
2014-15 to 2017-18. The decline largely reflects the net effect of the measure Tools For
Your Trade — cessation, with the Government instead providing financial assistance to
apprentices through Trade Support Loans — establishment, and Industry Skills Fund —
establishment which provides more targeted support to small and medium enterprises
to up-skill their workforce. Further information on these measures can be found in
Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15.

Expenses under the labour market assistance to job seeker and industry sub-function
between 2014-15 and 2017-18 are expected to increase by 23.5 percent in real terms due
to the net impact of the Job Commitment Bonus measure announced in the 2013-14
MYEFO and the measures Restart Wage — boosting the wage subsidy for mature age job
seekers and Stronger participation incentives for job seekers under 30 (see Budget Paper
No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15).

Expenses under the industrial relations sub-function are expected to increase by
3.9 percent in real terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 due to forecast higher demand
for assistance to claimants under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme (FEG).

                                               Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

Expenses between 2014-15 and 2017-18 are expected to decrease by 13.0 percent in real
terms, mainly due to the measure Fair Entitlements Guarantee — aligning redundancy
payments to national employment standards (see Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures
2014-15).

The main components of the immigration sub-function relate to the management of
Illegal Maritime Arrivals and providing migration, border management and
citizenship services.

Expenses under this sub-function are expected to decrease by 12.3 percent in real
terms between 2013-14 and 2014-15 and by 41.6 percent in real terms from 2014-15 to
2017-18. This is mainly due to a reduction in actual and forecast numbers of Illegal
Maritime Arrivals. Expenses for migration, border management and citizenship
services are expected to increase in line with estimated growth in visas issued.

Expenses under the other economic affairs (nec) sub-function are expected to be
relatively stable in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15 and decrease by 12.7 percent in
real terms from 2014-15 to 2017-18. This decrease is primarily due to the Government’s
decision to cease the Commercialisation Australia and Enterprise Solutions
programmes and reduce funding for the Cooperative Research Centres programme.
The terminated programmes will be replaced by the Entrepreneurs’ Infrastructure
Programme. Further information can be found in the measure Entrepreneurs’
Infrastructure Programme — establishment in Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures
2014-15.

Other purposes
The other purposes function includes expenses incurred in the servicing of public debt
interest, and assistance to State, Territory and local governments. This function also
includes items classified to natural disaster relief, the Contingency Reserve, and
expenses related to the nominal interest on unfunded liabilities for government
superannuation benefits.

(a) Amounts for the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) reflect expenses being
     recorded in the year in which the disaster occurs rather than when payments are made to State or
     Territory governments in relation to Australian Government financial obligations under the NDRRA.


Total expenses under the other purposes function are estimated to increase by
7.9 percent in real terms from 2013-14 to 2014-15, and by 19.1 percent over the period
2014-15 to 2017-18. This increase in expenses is primarily driven by general revenue
assistance paid to State and Territory governments, nearly all of which comprise
payments of GST entitlements provided on an ‘untied’ basis. Payments to State and
Territory governments tied to specific purposes are reported under the relevant
sections in this statement. Further information on general revenue assistance to the
States and Territories can be found in Budget Paper No. 3, Federal Financial Relations
2014-15.


The increase in expenses under the public debt interest sub-function in 2013-14 and
over the forward years is due to the increased issuance of Australian Government
Securities. Expenses under the nominal superannuation interest sub-function are
projected to increase over time, reflecting the growth in the Australian Government’s
superannuation liability. The Future Fund was established to assist in meeting the cost
of this liability. Further information on the Future Fund can be found in Statement 7 of
Budget Paper No. 1.


Expenses in the local government assistance sub-function relate to financial assistance
grants made to the States and Territories and consist of a general purpose component
and an identified local road component, both of which are untied, allowing councils to


                                                  6-45
Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

direct the grants to local priorities. Expenses are reduced in 2013-14 reflecting the
decision in the 2013-14 Budget to pay the first two instalments of the 2013-14 grants in
2012-13. Expenses are estimated to remain constant in nominal terms in 2014-15,
2015-16 and 2016-17 as a result of the Government’s decision to pause indexation of the
grants for three years commencing in 2014-15. Expenses are expected to increase from
2017-18 onwards as indexation of the grants recommences. Further information on
Australian Government assistance to local governments can be found in Budget
Paper No. 3, Federal Financial Relations 2014-15.


The natural disaster relief sub-function reflects financial support provided by the
Australian Government to affected States and Territories under the Natural Disaster
Relief and Recovery Arrangements. The profile over the forward estimates reflects the
requirement under accounting standards to recognise the majority of expenses for a
disaster in the year in which it occurs. No provision is made for future disasters.
Actual (cash) payments expected to be made to States and Territories are outlined in
Budget Paper No 3.

The contingency reserve sub-function comprises the Contingency Reserve. The
Contingency Reserve is an allowance, included in aggregate expenses, that principally
reflects anticipated events that cannot be assigned to individual programmes in the
preparation of the Australian Government budget estimates. The Contingency Reserve
is used to ensure that the estimates are based on the best information available at the
time of the Budget. It is not a general policy reserve.

While the Contingency Reserve is designed to ensure that aggregate estimates are as
close as possible to expected outcomes, it is not appropriated. Allowances that are
included in the Contingency Reserve can only be drawn upon once they have been
appropriated by Parliament. These allowances are allocated to specific agencies for
appropriation closer to the time when the associated events eventuate.

The Contingency Reserve also contains an allowance for the tendency for estimates of
expenses for existing Government policy to be revised upwards in the forward years,
known as the conservative bias allowance (CBA). The increase in expenses in the
contingency reserve sub-function from 2014-15 is largely due to the CBA. Since the
2013-14 MYEFO, the allowance has been drawn down to:

    zero in the Budget year (2014-15);
•

    ½ of a percentage point of total general government sector expenses (excluding GST
•
    payments to the States) in the first forward year (2015-16);

    1 percent of expenses in the second forward year (2016-17); and
•

    a 2 percent provision has been included in the third forward year (2017-18).
•

The drawdown of the allowance reduced expenses by $910 million in 2014-15,
$971 million in 2015-16 and $2.0 billion in 2016-17. The drawdown of the allowance is


                                          6-46
                                          Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

consistent with long standing practice and does not represent a saving or offset to
Government spending measures.

In general, the Contingency Reserve can also include:

    a provision for underspends in the current financial year reflecting the tendency for
•
    budgeted expenses for some agencies or functions not to be met;

    commercial-in-confidence and national security-in-confidence items that cannot be
•
    disclosed separately and programmes that are yet to be renegotiated with State and
    Territory governments;

    the effect, on the budget and forward estimates, of economic parameter revisions
•
    received late in the process and hence not able to be allocated to individual agencies
    or functions;

    decisions taken but not yet announced by the Government, and decisions made too
•
    late for inclusion against individual agency estimates; and

    provisions for other specific events and pressures that are reasonably expected to
•
    affect the budget estimates.

The provision made for election commitments at the time of the 2013-14 MYEFO has
been removed as these decisions are included in the 2014-15 Budget, with the
exception of Paid Parental Leave scheme, the Paid Parental Leave Levy and a company
tax rate reduction. An adjustment has been made to the cost of the Paid Parental Leave
scheme, on the basis of a reduction on the payment threshold from $150,000 to
$100,000 per annum.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment

General government net capital investment
Net capital investment is broadly defined as the sale and acquisition of non-financial
assets less depreciation expenses. It provides a measure of the overall growth in capital
assets (including buildings and infrastructure, specialist military equipment, and
computer software) after taking into account depreciation and amortisation as
previously acquired assets age.

Australian Government general government sector net capital investment is expected
to be $2.4 billion in 2014-15; $1.7 billion lower than the net capital investment in
2013-14. This change is largely due to the auction for most of the 700MHz and all the
2.5GHz spectrum conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority
in April and May 2013. Proceeds from the auction are recognised as revenue during
2014-15 when licences will be allocated to the successful bidders.

Details of movements are further explained in the following section.

Forecast net capital investment for 2014-15 has increased by $731 million since the
2013-14 MYEFO. This increase is driven by the effect of new policy decisions of
$388 million, and parameter and other variations of $343 million.

A discussion of changes between the 2013-14 MYEFO and the 2014-15 Budget, shown
in the table above, can be found in Statement 3. Further information on the capital
measures since MYEFO can be found in Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15.

A significant component of the Government’s net capital investment occurs in the
defence function, and is primarily the acquisition of military equipment. Major factors
contributing to changes in net capital investment, expected to occur in the following
functions, include:

    general public services — a number of factors contribute to the pattern of net
•
    capital investment in this function, including additional capital funding provided in
    the 2013-14 Budget to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to upgrade the
    International Communications Network and construction of a number of overseas
    facilities, and increased investment in 2013-14 and 2014-15 associated with the
    Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Property Strategy;

    defence — as part of the Government’s commitment to rebuild Defence, capital
•
    funding will be brought forward from 2017-18 into the period 2013-14 to 2016-17 to
    recapitalise it after a number of years of underinvestment and deferred funding of
    major capability projects. Capital funds from the Approved Major Capital
    Investment Programme and the Defence Capability Plan will be brought forward to
    address underinvestment in a range of important capabilities. This also includes
    funding brought forward into 2013-14 to meet capital requirements, especially in
    relation to foreign military purchases;

    public order and safety — this sub-function includes additional funding for the
•
    Australian Customs and Border Protection Service for the acquisition of Cape Class
    patrol vessels and to reform its border protection services, together with a

    reduction in 2015-16 following completion of the fit-out associated with the new
    Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) Central Office;

    transport and communication — the negative investment in 2014-15 is largely due
•
    to the auction conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority
    in April and May 2013 for most of the 700MHz and all the 2.5GHz spectrum.
    Proceeds from the auction are recognised as revenue during 2014-15 when licences
    will be allocated to the successful bidders. Further proceeds from the renewal of the
    telecommunication carrier’s 15 year licences for 1800MHz spectrum are also being
    recognised in 2014-15;

    other economic affairs — capital investment in 2013-14 and 2014-15 is largely for
•
    the construction of offshore processing facilities for the accommodation of Illegal
    Maritime Arrivals, in support of Operation Sovereign Borders; and

    other purposes — the negative investments in this function are largely due to the
•
    Government’s intention to sell the remaining 700MHz spectrum and the renewal of
    the telecommunications carrier’s 15 year licences for 2.1GHz spectrum.

DEBT STATEMENT
The Debt Statement provides information on current and projected debt on issue and
details of climate spending and the extent to which this spending has contributed to
debt.


Commonwealth Government Securities issuance
The Government finances its activities either through receipts or by borrowing. When
receipts fall short of payments, the Government borrows by issuing Commonwealth
Government Securities (CGS) to investors.

Even when CGS issuance is not required to finance the government’s activities,
successive governments have continued to issue CGS for policy purposes, such as to
maintain a liquid CGS market. A well-functioning CGS market supports the Treasury
Bond futures markets (used by financial institutions to manage interest rate risk),
supports the corporate bond market by providing a risk-free benchmark, and provides
a low-risk investment vehicle.

The Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is the agency responsible for
issuing CGS and the management of the Government’s financing activities. The AOFM
currently issues three types of securities:

Treasury Bonds: medium- to long-term securities with a fixed annual rate of interest
payable every six months;

Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs): medium- to long-term securities for which the capital
value of the security is adjusted for movements in the consumer price index (CPI).
Interest on TIBs is paid quarterly, at a fixed rate, on the adjusted capital value; and

Treasury Notes: short-term securities generally maturing within six months of
issuance. The volume of Treasury Notes on issue will vary over the course of the year,
depending on the size and profile of the within-year funding flows.

All new CGS issuance is undertaken in Australian dollars. There is a very small
amount of foreign currency denominated debt securities on issue remaining from
issuance undertaken before 1988. Most of these securities mature in March 2017.

Within these three broad categories of CGS, issuance is undertaken into a limited
number of maturities (known as lines). Each of these lines has a fixed maturity date
(the date on which the Government repays the principal it has borrowed) and, for


                                         7-3
Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Treasury Bonds and TIBs, a coupon rate (the annual fixed interest rate paid on the
security).

Concentrating CGS issuance into a limited number of lines (rather than issuing
securities with a specific time value, such as 10 years) ensures each line is sufficiently
large that it can easily be traded in the secondary market. Maintaining a limited
number of liquid lines promotes demand for CGS, and assists in lowering borrowing
costs.


Estimates and projections of CGS on issue
Estimates and projections of CGS on issue are published in both face value and market
value terms in this statement.

The face value of CGS on issue is the amount that the Government pays back to
investors at maturity, independent of fluctuations in market prices. 1 The total face
value of CGS on issue changes when new securities are issued, or when securities are
repurchased or reach maturity.

The market value of CGS represents the value of securities as traded on the secondary
market, which changes continuously with movements in market prices. Consistent
with external reporting standards the market value of CGS on issue is reported on the
Australian Government general government sector balance sheet. Changes in the
market price of CGS will have an impact on the value of net debt.

Table 1 contains projections of the face value (end-of-year and within-year peak) and
the market value (end-of-year) of CGS on issue.

As required by the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, Table 1 reports projections of
CGS on issue subject to the Treasurer’s Direction. The Treasurer’s Direction specifies
the maximum face value of stock and securities that can be on issue.

When considering these projections, it is important to note that the AOFM publishes
an issuance strategy for the budget year only. Projections beyond the budget year are
based on a set of technical assumptions and will vary with changes to these
assumptions and budget estimates and projections.




1   For TIBs, the final repayment amount paid to investors includes an additional amount owing
    to inflation accretion over the life of the security. This amount is not included in the
    calculation of face value.

(a) The face and market value of CGS published in this table are rounded to the nearest $10 billion.
(b) The precise within-year timing of cash receipts and payments is not known. Projected peaks of CGS on
    issue are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty.
(c) The Treasurer’s Direction applies only to the face value of CGS on issue. This table shows the
    equivalent market value of CGS that are subject to the Treasurer’s Direction. These figures will differ
    from the estimates and projections published in Statement 9: Budget Financial Statements
    Table 2: Australian Government general government sector balance sheet that refer to total CGS on
    issue.

The amount of CGS on issue subject to the Treasurer’s Direction is reported weekly on
the AOFM website.

In 2014-15, the face value of CGS on issue is expected to reach a within-year peak of
around $370 billion. Over the forward estimates, the face value of CGS on issue is
projected to rise to a within-year peak of around $470 billion in 2017-18.

Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Chart 1 shows the projected end-of-year face value of CGS on issue, as at the
2013-14 MYEFO and the 2014-15 Budget, over the medium term.

The published 2013-14 MYEFO face value of CGS on issue figure of $667 billion in
2023-24 did not include a cap on tax receipts. The projection for MYEFO in Chart 1
includes a 23.9 percent of GDP cap on tax receipts, increasing the face value of CGS on
issue projected to $748 billion in 2023-24.

In comparison, at 2014-15 Budget CGS on issue is projected to be $389 billion in
2023-24, an improvement of $359 billion. By 2024-25, the projected end-of-year face
value of CGS on issue is expected to reach $362 billion.

Over the medium term, the majority of the decrease in the face value of CGS on issue
since MYEFO can be attributed to an improvement in the underlying cash balance as a
result of policy decisions.

Further details on the changes to the underlying cash balance since the
2013-14 MYEFO can be found in Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook.


Changes in net debt since the 2013-14 MYEFO

Net debt in 2014-15 is estimated to decrease by $4.7 billion since the 2013-14 MYEFO to
$226.4 billion. From 2014-15 to 2016-17, net debt is lower compared to the 2013-14
MYEFO. This is primarily driven by the higher value of investments held by the
Government in newly established funds and other deposits. Changes in the financing
requirement have also resulted in a small reduction of net debt. These decreases are
partially offset by the impact of lower average yields compared to those at the 2013-14
MYEFO, which increases the market value of Commonwealth Government Securities
on issue.

Non-resident holdings of CGS on issue
The sale of CGS is not restricted to Australian residents. As at the December quarter
2013, 67.5 percent of total CGS on issue were held by non-residents of Australia
(Chart 2).

The proportion of CGS held by non-residents remains around historically high levels,
having risen significantly since 2009. This is likely to have been driven by the build-up
of foreign currency reserves in some countries, and the increasing tendency for these
reserves to be invested outside of the major currencies (such as the yen, the US dollar
and the euro).

The historically high proportion of non-resident holdings of CGS is also likely to have
been driven by a rise in investor confidence in the Australian sovereign debt market,
owing to the relative strength of Australia’s public finances and the Australian
economy more broadly. This is also contributing to demand for the Australian dollar.

The confidence in the Australian sovereign debt market and the overall subdued
global growth outlook has likely contributed to the favourable yields for Australian
sovereign debt.

Interest on CGS
The interest costs related to CGS are presented in these statements in both cash and
accrual accounting terms. The difference between the cash interest payments and
accrual interest expense generally relates to the timing of when the interest cost is
recognised;

    Interest payments are recognised in the period when they are paid during the life
•
    of the security.

    Interest expense is recognised in the period in which an expense is incurred during
•
    the life of the security, rather when they are actually paid.

Estimates of the interest payments and expense of CGS on issue include the cost of
CGS already on issue and future CGS issuance. The cost of:

    CGS already on issue uses the actual interest rates incurred at the time of issuance;
•
    and

    the expected future issuance of CGS is based on the prevailing market rates across
•
    the yield curve at the time of a budget estimates update.

The assumed market yields at the 2014-15 Budget result in a weighted average cost of
borrowing of around 3.7 percent for future issuance of Treasury Bonds in the forward
estimates period, compared with around 3.9 percent at the 2013-14 MYEFO. Chart 3

The Government’s interest payments and expense over the forward estimates mostly
relate to the cost of servicing the stock of CGS on issue, and are expected to increase
over the forward estimates as a result of the projected rise in CGS on issue.

The Government’s total interest payments in 2014-15 are estimated to be $14.2 billion,
of which $13.5 billion relates to CGS on issue (Table 9).

The Government’s interest expenses in 2014-15 are estimated to be $15.6 billion, of
which $14.7 billion relates to CGS on issue. In the 2013-14 MYEFO, interest expenses in
2014-15 were estimated to be $16.4 billion, of which $15.0 billion related to CGS on
issue. Table 10 shows the Government’s estimated interest expense, interest expense
on CGS, interest income and net interest expense over the forward estimates.

(a) Spending in this table is on a headline cash balance basis; that is, payments and net cash flows from
    investments in financial assets for policy purposes, as well as estimated interest receipts associated with
    Clean Energy Finance Corporation investments.


Over the forward estimates, the key components of climate spending are:
• the Emissions Reduction Fund, which will provide incentives to support abatement
  activities across the economy;

    funding for the Department of Industry to support Australian Renewable Energy
•
    Agency legacy functions;

    the free permit buyback facility provided as part of the Jobs and Competitiveness
•
    Programme and the Energy Security Fund, noting these programmes will be
    abolished from 2014-15; and

    previously committed expenditure from the Biodiversity Fund and the Clean
•
    Technology Programmes, noting these programmes will no longer be eligible for
    new applications beyond 2013-14.

The slight increase in climate spending in 2013-14 is primarily due to additional
investment by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation since MYEFO.

Impact of climate spending on debt
Receipts and debt are not specifically allocated to particular spending programmes. In
this context, there are multiple approaches that could be taken to consider the extent to
which spending on climate change has contributed to debt.

One approach is to assume that the proportion of climate spending being financed
through new debt (as opposed to receipts) is equivalent to climate spending as a



                                                     7-13

proportion of total spending. Table 12 shows the impact of climate change spending on
debt using this approach.

Recurrent and capital spending
In the 2013-14 MYEFO, the Government made a commitment to enhance disclosure in
the 2014-15 Budget on the proportion of the budget 2 allocated to recurrent and capital
spending.

The recurrent budget includes pension and income support payments, funding in the
areas of health and education (except where funding is allocated to the building of
facilities), interest payments on public debt, student loans, and operating costs of the
Government including payments to employees.

The capital budget comprises loans and other funding made to fund infrastructure,
including transport and communications infrastructure; and purchases of defence and
other non-financial assets.

Chart 4 below presents a detailed breakdown of recurrent and capital spending for the
2014-15 year.




2 Total budget is defined as all cash outflows within the underlying cash balance and headline cash balance
  (where identifiable). This is equal to total payments plus investments in financial assets for policy
  purposes (for example, loans and equity payments).


                                                    7-14
                                               Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Chart 4: Recurrent and capital spending as a proportion of the Budget in 2014-15




(a) Recurrent payments excluding payments to states and territories include pension and income support
    payments, government loans, payments to government employees, payments for goods and services,
    and grants and subsidies not made for capital purposes.
(b) Other capital purchases include the purchase of land and buildings, software and other facilities.
(c) Capital grants and subsidies include payments to recipients other than those within the general
    government, for example local governments.
(d) State and territory payments include payments for general revenue assistance (including Goods and
    Services Tax payments) and specific purpose payments.


Chart 4 shows that 91 percent of total budget spending estimates in 2014-15 is
recurrent, and the remaining 9 percent of the budget is capital.

Of the total budget, 72 percent comprises recurrent payments such as income support
payments, grants and subsidies to recipients other than states and territories, interest
payments on public debt, operating costs of the Government, and student loans.




                                                7-15
Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Payments to States and Territories to fund recurrent spending make up 20 percent of
the budget.3 This amount includes specific purpose payments to States and Territories,
including in the areas of health and education, and recurrent spending by the States
and Territories estimated to be funded through general revenue assistance.

Of the $36.2 billion of the capital budget, around $19.8 billion relates to specific
purpose payments to the states and territories for capital purposes and the portion of
General Revenue Assistance that is estimated to fund capital spending by the States
and Territories. Equity payments to NBN Co comprise around 14 percent of the
capital budget and purchases of defence capital (for example, defence weapons and
aircraft) comprises around 20 percent. Other capital purchases such as software
facilities upgrades make up around 10 percent of the capital budget, with the
remaining 1 percent funding capital loans, grants and subsidies to recipients other
than States and Territories.

Funding for the Infrastructure Growth Package is reflected in payments to States and
Territories for capital spending (for amounts paid to States and Territories) and other
capital loans, grants and subsidies (for amounts paid to local governments).


Additional Transparency — Medium term projections
To improve the transparency of the budget papers, the medium term projections in
this budget have been enhanced to encourage discussion and debate beyond the short
term about the benefits of funding important investments such as infrastructure.

Building on the presentation of the medium term in the 2013 Pre-Election Economic
and Fiscal Outlook, Budget Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook includes different
scenarios of the medium term outlook, for the underlying cash balance, total
payments, total receipts and CGS on issue.

Further, the Budget details the Government’s commitment to funding productivity-
enhancing infrastructure over the medium term.

The Government is investing $50 billion in infrastructure spending over the next
6 years, with this spending included in the forward estimates and medium term
projections. The Government’s infrastructure spending will also catalyse State and
private sector infrastructure investment, bringing total infrastructure spending to over
$125 billion.




3 The proportions of general revenue assistance which fund recurrent and capital spending has been
  estimated based on past data. Specific purpose payments are split into recurrent and capital in accordance
  with Government Finance Statistics.



                                                   7-16
                                          Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

The medium term fiscal projections in this budget include the expenditure on
infrastructure by the Commonwealth, but do not take into account the economic
benefits of this infrastructure.

When the over $125 billion of additional infrastructure projects catalysed by the
Government are completed, they will add one percentage point to the level of GDP.


THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT’S MAJOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Assets
The Government’s total stock of assets is estimated to be around $393.0 billion at
30 June 2014, increasing to $414.6 billion in 2014-15 and $506.1 billion by the end of the
forward estimates.

The Government’s financial assets are estimated to be $279.8 billion at 30 June 2014,
increasing to $297.4 billion in 2014-15 and $380.8 billion by the end of the forward
estimates.

The Government’s non-financial assets are estimated to be $113.2 billion at
30 June 2014, increasing to $117.2 billion in 2014-15 and $125.3 billion by the end of the
forward estimates.

Future Fund
The Future Fund was established in 2006 to accumulate financial assets and invest
them on behalf of the Australian Government to address the Government’s unfunded
superannuation liability.

The Investment Mandate for the Future Fund sets a benchmark return of at least CPI
plus 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent per annum over the long term. The Investment
Mandate gives guidance to the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Board) in relation
to its investment strategy. The Board is independently responsible for the investment
decisions of the Fund. The Investment Mandate also requires the Board to take an
acceptable but not excessive level of risk for the Fund, measured in terms such as the
probability of losses in a particular year.

The portfolio of assets has performed well, given the extent of uncertainty and
volatility in financial markets over the past five years. Since the first contribution to the
Future Fund on 5 May 2006, the return has been 6.8 percent per annum.

At 31 March 2014, the Future Fund’s return for the financial year to date was
9.8 percent.

The Future Fund was valued at $97.6 billion at 31 March 2014.



                                            7-17
Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

The Future Fund’s portfolio has now been substantially invested but will continue to
evolve as the Board manages the portfolio in line with its mandate and strategy.
Table 13 shows changes in the asset allocation of the Future Fund over 2013-14.

Asset Recycling Fund
The Asset Recycling Fund (ARF) to be established on 1 July 2014 will provide a
dedicated vehicle for providing funding and financial incentives primarily to the States
and Territories to invest in infrastructure, including under the Asset Recycling Initiative.

The ARF will be seeded with $5.9 billion of capital from uncommitted balances of the
Building Australia Fund (BAF) and Education Investment Fund (EIF). Further
contributions to the Fund will be made from proceeds from the sale of Medibank
Private and other privatisations.

Drawdowns from the ARF will be made from capital and net earnings. Such
drawdowns will primarily fund payments to States and Territories through the
Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Reform Fund, governed by the National
Partnership Agreements that will include those for the Asset Recycling Initiative and
Land Transport Infrastructure Projects.

The ARF will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Treasurer and
Minister for Finance will set an investment mandate for the Fund which will provide
broad direction to the Board in relation to its investment strategy.

The BAF and the EIF will be subsequently abolished on 1 January 2015. Remaining
committed milestone payments of the BAF and EIF will be transferred to consolidated
revenue to continue to be paid based on contractual obligations under the
responsibility of the relevant department.

Medical Research Future Fund
The Government will establish the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) on
1 January 2015 to provide additional funding for medical research from 2015-16,
primarily through payments to the National Health and Medical Research Council.



                                            7-18
                                          Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Contributions to the MRFF will come from $1 billion uncommitted funds within the
Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF), and the amounts equal to the estimated value of
health function savings measures published in the 2014-15 Budget until the Fund
reaches a target capital level of $20 billion. That is, every dollar of savings in health in
this budget will be given to the MRFF for the next six years, until the MRFF reaches
$20 billion.

Net earnings on MRFF capital for a given financial year will be available for
drawdown the following financial year. Payments met from drawdowns will be
determined through the annual Budget process. The capital of the Fund will be
preserved in perpetuity.

The MRFF will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Treasurer
and Minister for Finance will set an investment mandate for the Fund which will
provide broad direction to the Board in relation to its investment strategy.

The HHF will be abolished on 1 January 2015. Remaining committed milestone
payments of the HHF will be transferred to consolidated revenue to continue to be
paid based on contractual obligations under the responsibility of the Department of
Health.

DisabilityCare Australia Fund
The DisabilityCare Australia Fund (DCAF) will be established by 1 July 2014 to assist
the Commonwealth and the State and Territory governments with spending directly
related to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). This is consistent with the
commitment by governments to roll out the NDIS across Australia.

Revenue raised from increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point from
1.5 to 2 percent will be placed into the DCAF from 1 July 2014. The investments of the
DCAF will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Treasurer and
Minister for Finance will set an Investment Mandate for the DCAF which will provide
guidance to the Board in relation to its investment strategy for the Fund. The
Investment Mandate will outline the benchmark return and the risk profile of the
DCAF.

A fixed amount of the money flowing into the DCAF each year will be set aside for the
State    and    Territory    governments       consistent  with    the    DisabilityCare
Australia Fund Act 2013. In 2014-15, this fixed amount will be $825 million. Thereafter,
the amount to be set aside for the States and Territories in the DCAF will be indexed
annually by 3.5 percent over 10 years.

The State and Territory governments will be able to draw down from the DCAF when
they meet key conditions such as agreement to fully roll out the NDIS and milestones
relating to the participation of people with significant and permanent disability in the
scheme. The balance of the DCAF, after taking into account allocations to the States



                                           7-19
Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

and Territories, will be available to the Commonwealth to assist with meeting the
Commonwealth’s contribution to the NDIS.

Residential mortgage-backed securities
During the global financial crisis, the Australian Government directed the AOFM to
invest in high-quality AAA-rated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to
support competition from smaller lenders in residential mortgage and small business
lending markets. As a result, the AOFM directly invested $15.5 billion in high-quality
RMBS.

Conditions in the Australian securitisation market have improved substantially since
the introduction of the AOFM programme. Since September 2012, private demand for
securitisation had increased to the extent that the AOFM was not required to provide
any direct investment in new RMBS deals. Given the improvement in the market, the
former Government announced on 10 April 2013 that the program would close for new
investment.

Conditions have continued to improve since then. More than $25 billion of new RMBS
was issued in 2013, the highest in any calendar year since the crisis. Consistent with
the ongoing market recovery and increased demand for RMBS, the AOFM has sold
close to $850 million (in amortised face value terms) of its holdings over the past
12 months. As at the end of April 2014, the AOFM held $6.7 billion (in amortised face
value terms) of RMBS. The amortised face value of RMBS held by the AOFM is
projected to be $1.6 billion by the end of 2017-18.

The AOFM and the Treasury will continue to monitor conditions in the RMBS market
closely.

National Broadband Network
The Government is changing the National Broadband Network (NBN) to ensure it will
be delivered faster and at lower cost to the community. The Government has
instructed NBN Co Limited to continue to progress the fibre-to-the-premises,
fixed wireless and satellite rollouts while it undertakes a series of reviews to assess
current progress and ultimately re-design the rollout of the NBN to Australian
communities.

The Government has adopted the recommendation of its Strategic Review to pursue a
multi-technology mix rollout for the NBN. This approach incorporates
fibre-to-the-premises, fibre-to-the-node, hybrid-fibre coaxial cable, fixed wireless and
satellite technologies in the rollout mix.

The Government is also in the process of re-negotiating the Definitive Agreements
with Telstra and Optus. These agreements secure access to existing fixed-line
infrastructure. Their revision will reflect the Government’s changes to the NBN.




                                            7-20
                                        Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

Reflecting these changes, NBN Co’s equity requirements have been revised. Equity
from the Government in 2013-14 has reduced from $3.5 billion to $3.4 billion. Over the
life of the project, the Government’s equity contribution to NBN Co will be capped at
$29.5 billion.

Higher Education Loan Program
The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) comprises concessional loans to students
that enable them to defer payment of fees for diploma level and above courses, which
are paid back once earning an income above a certain level.

The value of HELP is estimated to be around $25.2 billion at 30 June 2014, which is
$0.3 billion lower than projected in the 2013-14 MYEFO. The value of HELP is
projected to grow to $43.6 billion in 2016-17, which is around $2.1 billion higher than
estimated in the 2013-14 MYEFO, and to reach $51.4 billion by the end of the forward
estimates.

This growth is largely a result of the estimated underlying increase in university
commencements over the forward estimates, deregulation of the higher education
sector, and the reduction in subsidies for Commonwealth supported places.

From 1 January 2016, the Government will fully deregulate higher education by
removing fee caps and expanding the demand-driven system to bachelor and
sub-bachelor courses at all approved higher education providers. Supported students
will continue to be able to defer the costs of their studies through HELP.

In addition, from 1 January 2016, the Government will rebalance student and
Commonwealth contributions towards a new student’s course fees by reducing
subsidies for Commonwealth-supported places by 20 percent on average.

Clean Energy Finance Corporation
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was established as a Commonwealth
Authority in August 2012 through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012
(CEFC Act).

The CEFC Act provides the CEFC with $10 billion over five years to invest in
renewable energy, low-emissions technology and energy efficiency projects.

Investment decisions are made by an independent board consistent with the CEFC Act
and the CEFC’s investment mandate.

The Australian Government has announced that it will abolish the CEFC.

Legislation to abolish the CEFC and transfer the CEFC’s existing assets and liabilities
to the Commonwealth is currently before Parliament. The Government will honour all
payments that are necessary as part of meeting our contractual obligations to



                                         7-21
Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

committed investments. These obligations will be met from the CEFC’s existing
funding, which will be transferred to a new CEFC transitional special account.


Liabilities
The Government’s total liabilities are estimated to be $579.4 billion at 30 June 2014,
increasing to $626.6 billion in 2014-15 and $733.4 billion by the end of the forward
estimates.

The Government’s major liabilities are CGS on issue and public sector employee
superannuation liabilities. For further information on CGS on issue, see the Debt
Statement.

Public sector employee superannuation liabilities
Public sector employee superannuation entitlements relating to past and present
civilian employees and military personnel are a financial liability on the Government’s
balance sheet. As set out in Box 1, the Government’s superannuation liability is
estimated to be around $157 billion at 30 June 2014 and $243 billion at 30 June 2050.

The Australian Government has never fully funded its superannuation liabilities in
relation to defined benefit schemes. For civilian employees, the major defined benefit
schemes are the Commonwealth Sector Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public
Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS). These schemes were closed to new members in
1990 and 2005 respectively. The Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan
(PSSap) was introduced on 1 July 2005 and provides fully funded accumulation
benefits for new civilian employees from that date.

For military personnel, the major defined benefit schemes are the Defence Force
Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (DFRDB) and the Military Superannuation and
Benefits Scheme (MSBS). The DFRDB was closed to new entrants in 1991.

The Government has decided to close the MSBS from 1 July 2016 (see Box 1).

The Government has also decided to enhance the indexation of Defence Forces
Retirement and Benefits (DFRB) Scheme and DFRDB benefit payments from
1 July 2014 for superannuants aged 55 and over. This has increased the unfunded
liability by $5.1 billion at 1 July 2014.

Even though the civilian and military schemes will all be closed from 1 July 2016, the
value of the Government’s unfunded superannuation liability is projected to continue
growing (in nominal terms) into the immediate future — although it is projected to
decrease as a proportion of GDP — and is forecast to reach $181 billion by the end of
the forward estimates. The increase in the liability partly results from the time value of
money which recognises future benefits being closer to maturity each year. It also
results from the accruing entitlements to current members of the civilian and military
defined benefit schemes.


                                            7-22
                                         Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities

An actuarially determined discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future
unfunded superannuation benefits. The long-term nature of the unfunded
superannuation liability requires the use of a discount rate that best matches the
duration of the liability. The value recorded on the balance sheet is highly sensitive to
the discount rate used. The use of a long-term discount rate for budget purposes
avoids the volatility that would occur by using current market yields on government
bonds which continually change. Consistent with the latest Long Term Cost Reports
for the civilian and military schemes, the discount rate currently applied is 6 percent
per annum. This rate is in the context of a long-term assumed rate of CPI inflation of
2.5 percent per annum.

Civilian defined benefit schemes
Changes in member behaviour, including members increasing their member
contributions and increasingly taking more of their benefit as a pension rather than as
a lump sum, have also increased the liability in 2013-14 by around $3 billion compared
to previous projections.

Statement 7: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities


 Box 1: Policy changes to military superannuation arrangements

 The Government’s decision to close the MSBS to new military personnel from
 1 July 2016 will reduce the Government’s unfunded liability by $126 billion by 2050.

 Chart 5 below shows, without the policy change, the Government’s projected
 unfunded superannuation liability would be $369 billion by 2050. As a result of the
 decision to close the MSBS, the Government’s unfunded superannuation liability is
 projected to be $243 billion by 2050.

                     STATEMENT 8: STATEMENT OF RISKS


  A range of factors may influence the actual budget outcome in future years. The
  Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 requires these factors to be disclosed in a
  statement of risks in each Budget and Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This
  statement outlines general fiscal risks, specific contingent liabilities and specific
  contingent assets that may affect the budget balances.

                STATEMENT 8: STATEMENT OF RISKS
The forward estimates of revenue and expenses in the 2014-15 Budget incorporate
assumptions and judgments based on the best information available at the time of
publication. A range of factors may influence the actual budget outcome in future
years. The disclosure of these factors in this statement increases the transparency of the
fiscal projections. For the first time, additional disclosures on loans over $200 million
have been included.

Events that could affect fiscal outcomes include:

    changes in economic and other parameters, particularly global economic
•
    developments;

    matters not included in the fiscal forecasts because of uncertainty about their
•
    timing, magnitude or likelihood; and

    the realisation of contingent liabilities or assets.
•

RISKS TO THE BUDGET — OVERVIEW
The revenue and expense estimates and projections published in the
2014-15 Budget Papers are based on a range of economic and other parameters. If the
economic outlook were to differ from that presented in the Budget, the revenue and
expense estimates and projections would also change. The sensitivity of Budget
estimates to changes in economic assumptions is discussed in Appendix A of
Statement 3.

The Australian economy is forecast to grow a little below its trend rate over the
forecast period. Global risks remain weighted to the downside while domestic risks are
evenly balanced. Moreover, the effects of the earlier economic downturn continue to
weigh on tax collections.

To the extent that unanticipated changes in economic circumstances occur, their
impact will flow through to government expense and revenue forecasts. For example,
over the past year weaker than expected growth in wages has been reflected in weaker
than expected tax revenue.

In addition, revenue forecasting relies on the observed historical relationships between
the economy, tax bases and tax revenues. Such relationships may shift as conditions
change and present a further risk to the estimates. For example, losses incurred during
the global financial crisis have posed particular challenges in estimating both the
quantum and timing of loss utilisation. Revenue forecasts also incorporate costings for
new policies which also typically have a margin of uncertainty.




                                              8-3
Statement 8: Statement of Risks

The Budget is subject to a number of contingent liabilities. A large number of these
contingent liabilities reflect indemnities, including those relating to the Department of
Defence, the Defence Materiel Organisation, the Future Fund Management Agency
and Future Fund Board of Guardians, and the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The Australian Government has also issued a number of guarantees, such as those
relating to guarantee schemes for the banking and financial sector, payments by the
Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and the superannuation liabilities of the
Commonwealth Bank prior to its sale to the private sector.

Other significant contingent liabilities relate to uncalled capital subscriptions and
credit facilities to international financial institutions and legal cases concerning the
Australian Government. The Government has robust and conservative strategies in
place to reduce its potential exposure to these contingent liabilities.

There have been several changes to both the quantifiable and unquantifiable risks since
the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2013-14 (MYEFO). General revaluations of
securities and deposits have led to certain risks such as the Guarantee of State and
Territory Borrowings and the Financial Claims Scheme being modified. Some new risk
items have also arisen since the MYEFO.

Contingent liabilities, contingent assets and other fiscal risks with a possible impact on
the forward estimates greater than $20 million in any one year, or $50 million over the
forward estimates period, are listed in this statement. Some financial information in
the text may not add to totals due to rounding. Information on contingent liabilities
and contingent assets is also provided in the Australian Government’s annual
consolidated financial statements and in the annual financial statements of
departments and other Government entities.

Table 1 outlines how fiscal risks, assets and liabilities and contingent assets and
liabilities are disclosed in the Budget. The 2014-15 Budget increases disclosure around
loans.

    $50 million over the forward estimates period, are considered material and disclosed in this Statement.
(d) Unearned income from charging guarantee fees is shown as a liability in the balance sheet.


ECONOMIC AND OTHER PARAMETERS
Changes in economic parameters represent a risk to the estimates included in the
Budget. The realisation of any of the domestic or internationally based risks discussed
in Statement 2 could potentially affect the Budget estimates. Appendix A of
Statement 3 examines the impact on receipts and payments of altering some of the key
economic assumptions underlying the Budget estimates.

FISCAL RISKS
Fiscal risks comprise general developments or specific events that may affect the fiscal
outlook. Some developments or events raise the possibility of a fiscal impact. In other
cases, the likelihood of a fiscal impact may be reasonably certain, but will not be
included in the forward estimates because the timing or magnitude is not known.

Major taxes such as company and individuals’ income taxes fluctuate significantly
with economic activity. Capital gains tax is particularly volatile and is affected by both
the level of gains in asset markets and the timing of when those gains are realised.
Similarly, superannuation fund income tax is affected by investment market returns.
Consistent with Government policy, the Budget estimates include the impact of the
repeal of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent tax from 1 July 2014. The timing



                                                      8-5
Statement 8: Statement of Risks

of the passage of the repeal bills beyond 1 July 2014 could cause variations in the
revenue forecast for these taxes.

The estimates and projections of revenue are subject to a number of general risks that
can affect taxation collections. These general risks include failure of the tax system to
keep pace with changes in the business environment, tax avoidance, court decisions,
Australian Taxation Office rulings and the outcome of compliance programmes. These
pressures may result in a shift in the composition of taxation collected from the various
tax bases and/or a change in the size of the tax base.

There are also a number of fiscal risks that may affect the expense estimates and
projections. In particular, demand driven programmes, which form the bulk of the
Government’s expenses, can fluctuate significantly with economic and social
conditions. If changes to these conditions are not anticipated this can have major
effects on expense levels. For example, an expected increase in the number of persons
unemployed in the population could lead to additional welfare related expenses. Fiscal
risks also include emergency foreign aid and potential natural disasters. Such
occurrences have in the past resulted in unexpected increases in expenses and may do
so again. Specific fiscal risks to the budget and forward estimates are detailed below.

The estimates for the Department of Defence include the cost of major overseas
operations of the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan and the Middle East in
2014-15. Funding is considered on a year-by-year basis and the forward estimates do
not provide for extensions of currently approved operations beyond 2014-15. This is
consistent with past practice. In the case of Operation Slipper and its supporting
operation, Operation Accordion, funding has been agreed to 31 December 2014. The
Department of Defence will likely have additional funding requirements for
Afghanistan operations after 2014.

Effective 19 July 2013, Australia has made up to A$1 billion available to the
Government of Indonesia in the form of a standby loan facility, to be drawn down
should Indonesia be unable to raise sufficient funds at reasonable interest rates on
global capital markets due to the impact of financial market volatility. Contributions to
the standby loan facility will also be provided by the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and the Government of Japan. This facility is available to
Indonesia up to 30 June 2014. A drawdown from the facility will be dependent on a
request from the Indonesian Government and subject to certain criteria being met. Any
funds provided will be repaid in full with interest.

The Australian Government has supported the Gold Coast’s bid to host the
2018 Commonwealth Games through the provision of commitments in areas such as
immigration, customs, work permits, taxation, security, protection of commercial
rights, and communications and information technology. Not all costs associated with
delivery of the commitments are available at this time.

                                                           Statement 8: Statement of Risks

The introduction of a 1500 gigalitre (GL) cap on Australian Government water
buybacks comes with a potential, but currently unquantifiable, fiscal risk for the
Government. If there is a substantial shortfall in sustainable diversion limit (SDL)
adjustments from supply measures, then the cap on water buybacks will be reached
and other potentially more expensive means of water recovery will need to be used to
meet SDLs. It will not be possible to identify whether this risk will be realised, and
what the financial implications are, until the SDL adjustment mechanism operates
in 2016.

There are a significant number of measures which impact on the Budget aggregates
that remain subject to the legislative process. If legislation is not passed by Parliament
as proposed, this may affect the estimates and projections of the Budget.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets of the Australian Government are listed
below by portfolio. These contingent liabilities and assets are a specific category of
fiscal risks. Broadly, they represent possible costs or gains to the Australian
Government arising from past events or decisions which will be confirmed or
otherwise by the outcome of future events that are not within the
Government’s control.

Contingencies reported in this statement include loan guarantees, non-loan
guarantees, warranties, indemnities, uncalled capital and letters of comfort, together
with those contingencies considered remote. These contingencies are in addition to the
liabilities and assets already recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the
Australian Government general government sector in Statement 9.

In general, information on contingent liabilities and assets is based on information
provided by Australian Government departments and entities and is current to
31 March 2014. In some cases, other dates are used and those are noted in the
relevant section.

SIGNIFICANT BUT REMOTE CONTINGENCIES
Agriculture
Compensation claims arising from suspension of livestock exports to Indonesia
The Australian Government has received correspondence that indicates there are a
number of potential claimants who are alleging losses due to the temporary
suspension of exports of live animals to Indonesia that was put in place on 7 June 2011.

The Australian Government is not currently a party to any litigated claims where legal
liability for financial compensation is being claimed in relation to this suspension. No
final quantum of damages has been calculated. The Department of Finance, which has
responsibility for Comcover (the Australian Government’s general insurance fund) is
managing these matters on behalf of, and in cooperation with, the Department of
Agriculture.

Communications
NBN Co Limited — Equity Agreement
The Australian Government has entered into an Equity Funding Agreement with
NBN Co. The Agreement formalises the Australian Government’s intention to provide
equity to fund the roll out of the National Broadband Network, with such funding
being conditional on the annual appropriation processes. In addition, it commits the
Australian Government, in the event of a termination of the National Broadband
Network roll out, to provide sufficient funds to NBN Co to meet its direct costs arising
from that termination. The NBN Co Equity Agreement terminates in 2021. As at
28 February 2014, NBN Co’s termination liabilities were estimated at $5.7 billion.

Telstra Financial Guarantee
The Australian Government has provided a guarantee to Telstra in respect of
NBN Co’s financial obligations to Telstra under the Definitive Agreements. The
Definitive Agreements are long-term contracts and, in the case of the infrastructure
component, involve terms of at least 35 years. The liabilities under the Definitive
Agreements arise progressively during the roll out of the network as infrastructure is
accessed and subscribers to Telstra’s existing network are disconnected. As at
28 February 2014, NBN Co had generated liabilities covered by the guarantee
estimated at $2.9 billion. The guarantee will terminate when NBN Co achieves
specified credit ratings for a period of two continuous years and either:

    the company is fully capitalised; or
•

    the Communications Minister declares, under the National Broadband Network
•
    Companies Act 2011, that, in his or her opinion, the National Broadband Network
    should be treated as built and fully operational.

Statement 8: Statement of Risks
Termination of the funding agreement with OPEL Network Pty Ltd
Following the termination of its agreement with OPEL Network Pty Ltd (OPEL) under
the Broadband Connect programme, the Australian Government made provision
towards costs incurred by OPEL in producing its Implementation Plan. OPEL was
wound up on 13 March 2009. Proceedings were commenced in the NSW Federal Court
by the OPEL Liquidators and Optus on 5 September 2013 in respect of the termination
of the funding agreement (including a claim relating to the costs for the preparation of
the Implementation Plan).

Defence
ADI Limited — Officers’ and Directors’ indemnities
Under the sale agreements for ADI Limited, the Australian Government agreed to
indemnify the Directors, officers and employees of ADI Limited for claims and legal
costs associated with assistance related to the sale of the Australian Government’s
shares in the company. The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to
ADI Limited for uninsured losses relating to specific heads of claims.

Defence indemnities and remote contingencies
As at 31 March 2014, the Department of Defence carried 1,609 instances of quantifiable
remote contingent liabilities valued at $3.8 billion. These significant remote contingent
liabilities are restricted in nature and details are not given due to reasons of
commercial in confidence and/or national security. In addition, the Department of
Defence carries 14 contingent liabilities and one contingent asset that are
unquantifiable and are considered remote.

As at 31 March 2014, the Defence Materiel Organisation carried 75 contingencies that
are quantifiable, to the value of $2.8 billion. These significant remote contingent
liabilities are restricted in nature and details are not given due to reasons of
commercial in confidence and/or national security. In addition, the Defence Materiel
Organisation carries 433 instances of contingencies (including Foreign Military
Sales) that are unquantifiable and are considered remote. While these contingencies
are considered remote, they have been reported in aggregate for completeness.

Litigation cases
The Department of Defence is involved in a wide range of litigation and other claims
for compensation and/or damages where the matters are not able to be finalised by
use of negotiation. The litigation includes common law liability claims, including
alleged injuries from workplace systems, practices and conduct. These include claims
arising out of reviews into Australian Defence Force and Defence culture. A number of
claims have also been received for damage caused by the use of a Defence
Practice Area.

Industry
Liability for damages caused by space activities
Under the United Nations Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused
by Space Objects, the Australian Government is liable to pay compensation for damage
caused to nationals of other countries by space objects launched from, or by, Australia.
The Government requires the responsible party for a space activity approved under
the Space Activities Act 1998 (the Act) to insure against liability for damage to third
parties for an amount not less than the maximum probable loss, up to a maximum of
$750 million indexed for inflation. Under the Act, the Government also accepts liability
for damage suffered by Australian nationals, to a maximum value of $3 billion above
the insured level.

Infrastructure and Regional Development
Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited — Board Members’ Indemnity
Indemnities for Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited (MIFCO) board
members were provided to protect them against civil claims relating to their
employment and conduct as Directors. MIFCO was placed into voluntary liquidation
on November 2006 and was deregistered on 24 April 2008. The indemnity is not time
limited and continues even though the company has been liquidated. Until the
indemnity agreements are varied or brought to an end, they will remain as contingent
and unquantifiable liabilities.

Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited — Board Members’ Indemnity
The Australian Government has provided certain indemnities for the board members
of the Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited (MIC) to protect them against civil
claims relating to their employment and conduct as directors. The indemnities apply to
the period of appointment as board members of the company. Until the indemnity
agreements are varied or brought to an end, they will remain as contingent and
unquantifiable liabilities.

Tripartite deeds relating to the sale of federal leased airports
The tripartite deeds between the Australian Government, the airport lessee company
and financiers amend the airport (head) leases to provide for limited step-in-rights for
financiers in circumstances where the Australian Government terminates the head
lease to enable the financiers to correct the circumstances that triggered such a
termination event. The tripartite deeds may require the Australian Government to pay
financiers compensation as a result of its termination of the (head) lease. The
Australian Government’s contingent liabilities are considered to be unquantifiable and
remote.

Statement 8: Statement of Risks
Treasury
Financial Claims Scheme
The Financial Claims Scheme provides depositors of authorised deposit taking
institutions (ADIs) and claimants of general insurers (GIs) with timely access to their
funds in the event of a financial institution failure.

Under the Banking Act 1959 the scheme provides a mechanism for making payments to
depositors under the Government’s guarantee of deposits in ADIs. Payments are
capped at $250,000 per account holder per ADI. As at 31 December 2013, deposits
eligible for coverage under the Scheme were estimated to be approximately
$722.8 billion, compared to $692.3 billion at 30 June 2013, reflecting overall deposit
growth in the financial system.

Under the Insurance Act 1973 the scheme provides a mechanism for making payments
to eligible beneficiaries with a valid claim against a failed general insurer.

In the very unlikely event of an ADI or general insurer failure, any payments made
under the Financial Claims Scheme would be recovered through the liquidation of the
failed institution. If there was a shortfall in the amount recovered through the
liquidation of the failed institution, a levy could be applied to the relevant industry to
recover the difference between the amount expended and the amount recovered in the
liquidation.

From 2016, subject to the outcomes of the Financial System Inquiry, any payment
under the Financial Claims Scheme relating to ADIs would initially be met from the
Financial Stability Fund announced in the 2013 Economic Statement. In this case, a levy
could be applied to ADIs to recover the difference between the amount expended and
the amount recovered in the liquidation and from the Financial Stability Fund.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is responsible for the
administration of the Financial Claims Scheme. Under the Financial Claims Scheme
any payments to eligible depositors or claimants will be made out of APRA’s Financial
Claims Scheme Special Account. Under the legislation, initial amounts available to
meet payments and administer the Financial Claims Scheme, in the event of activation
are $20.1 billion per institution.

Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing
The Australian Government announced on 25 March 2009 that a voluntary, temporary
guarantee would be put in place over State and Territory borrowing. The Guarantee of
State and Territory Borrowing commenced on 24 July 2009 and closed on
31 December 2010.

Securities covered by the guarantee will continue to be guaranteed until these
securities either mature or are bought back and extinguished by the issuer.

                                                           Statement 8: Statement of Risks
The expected liability under the guarantee is remote and unquantifiable. Australian
Government expenditure would arise under the guarantee, only in the unlikely event
that a State or Territory failed to meet its obligations with respect to a commitment that
was subject to the guarantee and the guarantee was called upon. In such a case, the
Government would likely be able to recover any such expenditure through a claim on
the relevant State or Territory at a future date. The impact on the Government’s budget
would depend upon the extent of the default and the State or Territory’s ability to
meet the Government’s claim.

As at 31 March 2014, the face value of State and Territory borrowings covered by the
guarantee was $19.0 billion, down from $21.0 billion at 31 October 2013.

Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding
The Australian Government announced the guarantee of eligible deposits and
wholesale funding for authorised deposit taking institutions from 12 October 2008
under the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding.

On 7 February 2010, the then government announced that the Guarantee Scheme
would close to new liabilities on 31 March 2010. Since 31 March 2010, Australian
authorised deposit taking institutions have been prohibited from issuing any new
guaranteed wholesale funding or accepting new guaranteed deposits above $1 million.
Existing guaranteed wholesale funding is guaranteed to maturity. Depositors who
covered their balances above $1 million under the Guarantee Scheme can have those
funds covered to maturity for term deposits up to five years, or until October 2015 for
at call deposits.

The expected liability under the Guarantee Scheme is remote and unquantifiable.
Government expenditure would arise under the guarantee only in the unlikely event
that an institution failed to meet its obligations with respect to a commitment that was
subject to the guarantee and the guarantee was called upon. In such a case, the
Government would likely be able to recover any such expenditure through a claim on
the relevant institution. The impact on the Government’s budget would depend on the
extent of the institution’s default and its ability to meet the Government’s claim.

As at 28 March 2014, total liabilities covered by the Guarantee Scheme were estimated
at $25.3 billion, down from $40.7 billion at 25 October 2013. This is made up of
$2.3 billion of large deposits and $22.9 billion (down from $38.4 billion at
25 October 2013) of long-term wholesale funding. All guaranteed short-term wholesale
funding matured in March 2011.

As at 28 February 2014, institutions participating in the Guarantee Scheme had paid
fees of $4.4 billion since its inception.

Guarantees under the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995
Under the terms of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995, the Australian Government
has guaranteed various superannuation and other liabilities: $748.3 million is
attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as at

                                          8-15
Statement 8: Statement of Risks
31 December 2013, and $4.2 billion is attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth
Bank Officers’ Superannuation Corporation, as at 31 December 2013.

Reserve Bank of Australia — guarantee
The Australian Government guarantees the liabilities of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
measured as the Bank’s total liabilities excluding capital, reserves, and
Australian Government deposits. The major component of the Bank’s liabilities is notes
(that is, currency) on issue. Notes on issue amount to $60.4 billion, as at 2 April 2014,
and the total guarantee is $91.7 billion ($65 billion at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal
Outlook 2013-14).

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES — UNQUANTIFIABLE
Agriculture
Compensation claims arising from equine influenza outbreak
The Australian Government may become liable for compensation should it be found
negligent in relation to the outbreak of equine influenza in 2007.

Proceedings have commenced in the Federal Court of Australia by Maurice Blackburn
Lawyers with Attwood Marshall Lawyers who represent a closed class of
586 applicants claiming damages as a result of the 2007 equine influenza outbreak. No
final quantum of damages sought can be calculated. The Department of Finance which
has responsibility for Comcover (the Australian Government’s general insurance fund)
has assumed responsibility for the potential claims under its insurance arrangements
with the Department of Agriculture.

Emergency pest and disease response arrangements
National emergency response arrangements for animal, plant and environmental pest
and disease outbreaks are largely funded through cost sharing agreements between
Australian governments and, where relevant, agricultural industry bodies. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Australian Government is typically liable for 50 percent
of total government funding to respond to a disease or pest outbreak. Limited funding
is provided in the forward estimates for the Australian Government’s contribution
under emergency response agreements with States and Territories. This funding is
unlikely to be sufficient to meet the unquantifiable costs of a major outbreak or large
scale emergency response exercise.

The Australian Government may be expected to contribute bilaterally in situations
where an incursion is not covered by a cost sharing agreement or where the relevant
industry body is not party to an agreement. The Australian Government may also
provide financial assistance to an industry party by funding its initial share of the
response. These contributions may subsequently be recovered from the industry over a
10-year period, usually by a levy.

Attorney-General’s
Native Title agreements — access to geospatial data
The Australian Government has entered into agreements with State and Territory
government bodies and/or their agents to access their geospatial land tenure data,
which is essential to support the National Native Title Tribunal in achieving its
outcomes. Under these agreements, the Australian Government provides indemnities
against third-party claims arising from errors in the data.

Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas Payment
The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas)
Act 2012 inserted Part 2.24AA into the Social Security Act 1991 (the Act) to create a
scheme for providing financial assistance to Australians who are victims of an overseas
terrorist act that has been declared by the Prime Minister. The scheme commenced on
22 January 2013. Under the scheme, Australians harmed (primary victims) and
Australians who are close family members of a person who dies as a direct result of a
declared terrorist act (secondary victims) will be able to claim payments of up to
$75,000. As acts of terrorism are unpredictable, the cost of the scheme is
unquantifiable.

Disaster Recovery
The Australian Government provides funding to States and Territories through the
Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) to help pay for natural
disaster relief and recovery costs. A State or Territory may claim NDRRA funding if a
natural disaster occurs and State or Territory relief and recovery expenditure for that
event meets the requirements set out in the NDRRA Determination. For major natural
disasters, payments to individuals may be approved under the Social Security Act 1991.
These include the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster
Recovery Allowance. As natural disasters and their impacts are unpredictable, the cost
of future disasters is unquantifiable and not included in the forward estimates.

Further, while the current forward estimates for the programme are based on the best
information available at the time of preparation, preliminary estimates of the cost of a
disaster and the timing of expenditure are subject to change and the total cost of relief
and recovery from these events may not be completely realised for some years.
Estimates of all natural disasters are regularly reviewed and revised by the States and
Territories as new information becomes available, and this, or the occurrence of future
natural disasters, can in turn significantly affect the Australian Government’s
estimated NDRRA liability and payments.

Severe tropical cyclone Ita recently struck Far North Queensland. There is a risk that a
preliminary estimate of the Government’s NDRRA liability as a result of tropical
cyclone Ita will not be available for some time, as Queensland continues to assess the
cost of recovery from the event. The total cost of relief and recovery from this event is
unlikely to be completely realised for some years.

Statement 8: Statement of Risks
Native Title costs
The Australian Government can assist State and Territory governments in meeting
certain Native Title costs pursuant to the Native Title Act 1993 (the NTA), including
compensation costs. A National Partnership Agreement was executed in 2010 between
the Australian Government and Victoria, under which the Australian Government
provided a contribution towards the settlement of two native title claims. No other
agreement has been entered into to date.

The Australian Government will also be liable for any compensation found to be
payable under the NTA (and potentially also the Constitution) in respect of
compensable acts for which the Australian Government is responsible. The Australian
Government’s liability in both scenarios cannot be quantified owing to uncertainty
about the number and effect of compensable acts and the value of Native Title affected
by those acts.

Communications
NBN Co Limited — Board Members’ Insolvency Indemnity
The Australian Government has provided each Director of NBN Co with an indemnity
against liability as a result of the Government failing to meet its funding obligations to
NBN Co. The liabilities covered by this indemnity would be the same as those covered
by the NBN Co Equity Agreement, with the exception of any legal expenses incurred
by individual Directors arising from this indemnity. Directors are also indemnified in
relation to claims arising out of their involvement in the negotiation and entry by
NBN Co into the Financial Heads of Agreement with Telstra.

Defence
Cockatoo Island Dockyard
On 13 October 2001, Cockatoo Island Dockyard (CODOCK) commenced proceedings
against the Australian Government (Defence) in the NSW Supreme Court seeking full
reimbursement from the Australian Government for personal injury claims costs
incurred by CODOCK after 31 October 1995 in relation to asbestos exposure.
Following decisions in the NSW Supreme Court on 17 December 2004 and
4 February 2005, and the NSW Court of Appeal on 23 November 2006, CODOCK was
awarded a complete indemnity from the Australian Government for its uninsured
exposure to asbestos damages claims, plus profit of 7.5 percent.

Land decontamination, site restoration and decommissioning of Defence assets
The Department of Defence (Defence) has made financial provision for the future
estimates involved in land decontamination, site restoration and decommissioning of
Defence assets where a legal or constructive obligation has arisen in relation to those
underlying assets. For those decontamination, restoration and decommissioning
activities for which there is no legal or constructive obligation, the potential costs have
not been assessed and are unquantifiable. Where there is a possible legal or
constructive obligation and potential costs are unquantifiable, these have been
disclosed as a note to Defence’s financial statements.

Defence non-remote contingent liabilities
The Department of Defence has 15 instances of contingencies that are unquantifiable.

Employment
Job Services Australia — Employment Pathway Fund
The estimates for the Department of Employment Job Services Australia (JSA)
programme include anticipated expenditure for the Employment Pathway Fund (EPF).
The EPF provides a flexible pool of funding available to JSA providers to deliver
assistance to job seekers to help them find and keep a job. Amounts are credited to the
EPF based on a job seeker’s assessed level of disadvantage. Experience with the EPF
suggests that all credits will not be used during the life of the JSA contracts. The
forward estimates do not include the value of residual credits from the EPF that are
not expected to be spent during the current contract period.

Finance
ASC Pty Ltd — Directors’ indemnities
The Australian Government has provided former Directors of the Australian
Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd (ASC) with indemnities in relation to three matters: for
any claim against them as a result of complying with the ASC’s obligations under the
Process Agreement between the Electric Boat Corporation (EBC), the Australian
Government and the ASC; for any claim against them as a result of complying with the
ASC’s obligations under the Service Level Agreement between the ASC, the
Department of Defence, EBC and Electric Boat Australia; and for any claims and legal
costs arising from the Directors acting in accordance with the Board’s tasks and
responsibilities, as defined under the indemnity.

Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation — immunity and indemnity
The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011 (the
Governance Act) provides for specific immunities for activities undertaken in good
faith by Directors and delegates of the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation
Corporation (CSC), provided these activities relate to the performance of their
functions. These immunities do not prevent CSC from being subject to any action,
liability, claim or demand. Under the Governance Act, other than in cases where the
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 or regulations under that Act do not so
permit, any money that becomes payable by CSC in respect of an action, liability, claim
or demand that relates to the superannuation schemes or funds for which it is
responsible, is to be paid out of the relevant superannuation fund or if there is no fund,
the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). Amounts paid from a superannuation fund are
reimbursed to the fund from the CRF.

Future Fund Management Agency and Future Fund Board of Guardians —
indemnity
The Australian Government has provided certain staff members of the Future Fund
Management Agency (FFMA) and the members of the Future Fund Board of
Guardians (Board members) with Deeds of Indemnity. The indemnities are intended to

                                          8-19
Statement 8: Statement of Risks
cover liabilities in excess of the insurance policies of the Future Fund Board and its
subsidiary entities and the Agency. Board members are indemnified in relation to the
exercise of their powers and performance of their functions as members of the Future
Fund Board of Guardians. Agency staff members are indemnified in connection with
the performance of functions or the exercise of powers in their capacity as a Director or
officer of Future Fund Board of Guardians investee companies and/or subsidiaries.
Both staff members of the FFMA and Board members are indemnified, to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

Agency staff members are not indemnified to the extent they are indemnified by an
investee company or a subsidiary or they are paid under a Directors and Officers
policy of the investee company or subsidiary or to the extent that they are granted and
receive financial assistance under Appendix E of the Legal Services Directions. Both
Board members and Agency staff members are not indemnified for conduct they
engage in other than in good faith; or in respect of any liability owed to the Board or
the Australian Government; or in respect of any act or omission that contravenes one
of the civil penalty provisions of the Future Fund Act 2006 (the Future Fund Act). Board
members and Agency staff are not indemnified for legal costs incurred by them in
unsuccessfully defending or resisting criminal proceedings, or proceedings against a
declaration that they have breached a civil penalty provision of the Future Fund Act.
The indemnity is financially limited, in broad terms, to the value of the funds under
management by the Future Fund Board of Guardians.

Googong Dam
On 4 September 2008, a 150 year lease for Googong Dam was signed between the
Australian Government and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government. The
Australian Government is liable to pay just terms compensation if the terms of the
lease are breached by introducing new legislation or changing the Canberra Water
Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 in a way that impacts on the rights of the ACT. The
lease includes a requirement for the Australian Government to undertake rectification
of easements or any defects in title in relation to Googong Dam, and remediation of
any contamination it may have caused to the site. It also gives an indemnity in relation
to acts or omissions by the Australian Government.

Indemnities for the Reserve Bank of Australia and private sector banks
In accordance with Government entities’ contracts for transactional banking services,
the Australian Government has indemnified the Reserve Bank of Australia and
contracted private sector banks against loss and damage arising from error or fraud by
the entity, or transactions made by the bank with the authority of the entity.

Indemnities relating to other former asset sales, privatisations and information
technology outsourcing projects
Ongoing indemnities have been given in respect of a range of asset sales, privatisations
and information technology (IT) outsourcing projects that have been conducted by the
Department of Finance (Finance), and the former Office of Asset Sales and Commercial
Support and its predecessors. The probability of an action being made under one of

these indemnities diminishes over time. Details of indemnities in respect of the other
asset sales and privatisations have been provided in previous Budget and MYEFO
papers, and previous annual reports of Finance and the Office of Asset Sales and
Commercial Support.

Indemnities (including the year they were raised) are still current for: ADI Ltd (1998),
Australian Airlines (1991), Australian Industry Development Corporation (1996),
Australian Multimedia Enterprise (1997), Australian National Rail Commission and
National Rail Corporation Ltd (1997 and 2000), Australian River Co Ltd (1999),
Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd (2000), ComLand Ltd (2004), Bankstown

National Transmission Network (1999), Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd (2001),
Telstra (1996, 1999 and 2006), and Wool International (1999). Apart from instances
noted elsewhere, Finance does not currently expect any other action to be taken in
respect of these indemnities.

Australian Government general insurance fund — Comcover
The Department of Finance (Finance) through Comcover, the Australian Government’s
general insurance fund, provides insurance and risk management services to the
Australian Government general government sector. Finance’s liability for outstanding
claims, which includes the expected future cost of claims notified and claims incurred
but not reported, is subject to inherent uncertainty in the estimation process.

Australian Government domestic property
The Australian Government’s domestic property portfolio managed by the
Department of Finance has approximately 100 properties. A small number of these
have had potential remediation issues identified, which are currently the subject of
further investigation. Except for one property at Lucas Heights NSW, none of the
remaining properties with potential remediation issues has had a provision recognised
as the conditions for neither legal nor constructive obligations have been met, nor is a
reliable estimate of the obligation currently possible.

Litigation — Davis Samuel case
The Australian Government was subject to a counter-claim for damages in legal action
before the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. The Australian Government is
seeking to recover funds which were misappropriated from the former Department of
Finance and Deregulation during 1998. The judgment, handed down on 1 August 2013,
dismissed the counter claim against the Australian Government and found in favour of
the Australian Government in its claims against the defendants. Final orders are yet to
be made. The Court extended the time for appeals to 28 days after final orders are
made.

implementation of EFIC’s alliance/divestment of its short-term export credit
insurance business.

Health
Australian Medical Association
An agreement is held between the Australian Medical Association, the Australian
Government, the Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd, the Australian Health
Insurance Association and Beyond Blue Ltd for participation in, and support of, the
Private Mental Health Alliance and for the collection and analysis of a national
minimum data set from private, hospital-based psychiatric services. Each party to the
agreement has agreed to indemnify each other in respect of any loss, liability, cost,
claim or expense, misuse of confidential information, or breach of the Privacy Act 1988.
Each party’s liability to indemnify the other parties will be reduced proportionally to
the extent that any unlawful or negligent act or omission of the other parties or their
employees or agents contributed to the loss or damage. The indemnity survives the
expiration or termination of the agreement.

Australian Red Cross Society — indemnities
Deeds of Agreement between the Australian Red Cross Society (the Red Cross) and the
National Blood Authority in relation to the operation of the Australian Red Cross
Blood Service and the development of principal manufacturing sites in Sydney and
Melbourne include certain indemnities and a limitation of liability in favour of the
Red Cross. These cover defined sets of potential business, product and employee risks
and liabilities. The indemnities and limitation of liability only operate in the event of
the expiry and non-renewal, or the earlier termination, of the Deed of Agreement
relating to the operation of the Red Cross or the cessation of funding for the principal
sites, and only within a certain scope. They are also subject to appropriate limitations
and conditions including in relation to mitigation, contributory fault, and the process
of handling relevant claims.

Blood and blood products liability cover
A National Managed Fund (NMF) has been established between the Australian
Government, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (the Blood Service) and the State
and Territory governments which spreads the liability risks associated with the supply
of blood and blood products by the Blood Service. The NMF provides for liabilities
incurred by the Blood Service where other available mitigation or cover is not
available. Under certain conditions, the Australian Government and the State and
Territory governments may jointly provide indemnity for the Blood Service through a
cost sharing arrangement for claims, both current and potential, regarding personal

injury and loss or damage suffered by a recipient of certain blood products. If there
are insufficient funds in the NMF to cover claim costs, the Jurisdictional Blood
Committee will consider a report provided by the National Funds Manager to
determine the level of additional funds required. The Australian Government’s share
of any additional liability is limited to 63 percent of any agreed net cost.

CSL Ltd
CSL Ltd (CSL) is indemnified against claims made by individuals who contract
specified infections from specified products and against employees contracting
asbestos-related injuries. CSL has unlimited cover for most events that occurred before
the sale of CSL on 1 January 1994, but has more limited cover for a specified range of
events that occurred during the operation of the Plasma Fractionation Agreement from
1 January 1994 to 31 December 2004. Where alternative cover was not arranged by
CSL, the Australian Government may have a contingent liability.

The Australian Fractionation Agreement with CSL Behring (Australia) Ltd, a
subsidiary of CSL Ltd, which has operated since 1 January 2010, includes a
requirement that the National Blood Authority make a defined payment to CSL
Behring (Australia) Ltd, in certain circumstances only, in the event that the volume of
plasma supplied annually to CSL Behring (Australia) Ltd is less than a specified
amount.

Indemnities relating to vaccines
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to the manufacturer of
smallpox vaccine held by the Australian Government, covering possible adverse
events that could result from the use of the vaccine in an emergency situation. Further,
under certain conditions, certain indemnities have been provided to particular
manufacturers of pandemic and pre-pandemic influenza vaccines for the supply or
future supply of influenza vaccines (including H1N1 and H5N1).

Medical Indemnity Exceptional Claims Scheme
In May 2003, the Australian Government announced that the Medical Indemnity
Exceptional Claims Scheme was to assume liability for 100 percent of any damages
payable against a doctor that exceeds a specified level of cover provided by that
doctor’s medical indemnity insurer (currently $20 million). These arrangements
would apply to payouts either related to a single large claim or to multiple claims that
in aggregate exceed the cover provided by the doctor’s medical indemnity insurer, and
would apply to claims notified under contracts-based cover since 1 January 2003.

Australia. The indemnity includes liabilities or claims arising in relation to the NHFB in
two respects:

(i)    liabilities or claims arising from acts or omissions of NHFB staff as users of pool
       account information; and

(ii)   liabilities or claims arising from unauthorised access to the banking services or
       system from NHFB premises.

NSW HAC has provided a reciprocal indemnity for the actions of staff of the NHFB to
the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Tobacco plain packaging litigation
In 2014-15, the Government will continue to fund the defence of legal challenges to the

these cases has not been disclosed on the grounds that it may prejudice the outcomes of
these cases or may relate to commercial information.

Immigration and Border Protection
Northern Maritime Patrol and Response — Triton
The Australian Government has entered into a contractual arrangement with Gardline
Australia Pty Ltd until 31 December 2014 for the provision of a vessel to strengthen
enforcement activities in Australia’s northern waters. The contract with Gardline
Australia contains unquantifiable indemnities relating to the use, or other operations,
of armaments and the presence of armaments on the vessel. It also contains
unquantifiable indemnities relating to damage to any property or injury to any person
caused by the apprehended or escorted persons or their vessel.

Immigration detention services by state and territory governments — liability
limit
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) has negotiated
arrangements with a number of state and territory governments for the provision of
various services (including health, education, corrections and policing services) to
immigration detention facilities and people in immigration detention. Some
jurisdictions are seeking indemnification by the Australian Government for the
provision of those services.

In December 2013, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection wrote to the
Minister for Finance seeking agreement under regulation 10 of the Financial
Management and Accountability Regulations 1997 (FMA Regulations) for expenditure
that may become payable under those arrangements.

In February 2014, the Minister for Finance agreed that DIBP may consider entering
arrangements which include the proposed indemnities, based on the framework
parameters. The Minister for Finance also proposed that the framework agreed by
DIBP and the Department of Finance be varied to include all states and territories for
the police and support services stream.

the conduct of activities authorised under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology
Organisation Act 1987. This indemnity is in addition to commercial insurance cover
obtained from the Comcover Insurance Pool and other insurers.

British atomic test site at Maralinga
The Australian Government is responsible for 14 unlimited indemnities relating to the
Maralinga Rehabilitation Project (1995-2000). In November 2009, the Australian
Government agreed to the handback of the former nuclear test site — Maralinga
section 400 — to the site’s Traditional Owners, Maralinga Tjarutja. Under the terms of

the Maralinga Nuclear Test Site Handback Deed, the Australian Government has
indemnified the Maralinga Tjarutja people and the South Australian Government in
respect of claims arising from test site contamination.

Gorgon liquefied natural gas and carbon dioxide storage project — long-term
liability
The Australian and Western Australian governments have agreed in principle to
provide an indemnity to the Gorgon Joint Venture Partners (GJV) to indemnify the
GJV against independent third-party claims (relating to stored carbon dioxide) under
common law following closure of the carbon dioxide sequestration project, and subject
to conditions equivalent to those set out in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas
Storage Act 2006. It is proposed that the Western Australian Government will
indemnify the GJV, and that the Australian Government will indemnify the Western
Australian Government for 80 percent of any amount determined to be payable under
that indemnity. The formal agreement between the Australian and Western Australian
governments in relation to the indemnity is expected to be signed in 2014-15.

Snowy Hydro Limited — water releases
The Australian, New South Wales and Victorian governments have indemnified
Snowy Hydro Limited for liabilities arising from water releases in the Snowy River
below Jindabyne Dam, where these releases are in accordance with the water licence
and related regulatory arrangements agreed between the three governments. The
indemnity applies to liabilities for which a claim is notified within 20 years from
28 June 2002.

Liability for costs incurred in a national liquid fuel emergency
The Australian Government has responsibility for the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984
(the Act). In addition, the Australian Government and State and Territory
governments have entered into an inter-governmental agreement in relation to a
national liquid fuel emergency (IGA 2006). Under the IGA, the Australian Government
agrees to consult IGA parties on a likely shortage and, if necessary after those
consultations, to advise the Governor-General to declare a national emergency under
the Act.

The IGA also contains three areas where the Australian Government may incur
expenses in the unlikely event of a national liquid fuel emergency. These relate to the
direct costs of managing a liquid fuel emergency and include the possibility of the
Australian Government reimbursing the State and Territory governments for costs
arising from their responses, and potential compensation for industry arising from
Australian Government directions under the Act.

Infrastructure and Regional Development
Indemnity provided to the New South Wales Rural Fire Fighting Service in
relation to the Jervis Bay Territory

volunteer brigade located in the Jervis Bay Territory (JBT). To provide this service, the
NSW RFS requires the Australian Government to provide an uncapped indemnity
whereby the Australian Government would be liable for any damage caused as a
result of the actions of the NSW RFS in the JBT while fighting a fire. The likelihood of
an event occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian Government has
been assessed as very remote and the risks are currently mitigated through the training
and professional qualifications of the NSW RFS staff.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority incident costs
In the normal course of operations, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is
responsible for the provision of funds necessary to meet the clean-up costs arising from
ship-sourced marine pollution and, in all circumstances, is responsible for making
appropriate efforts to recover the costs of any such incidents. The Australian
Government meets costs that cannot be recovered from such incidents. It is not
possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be required in
relation to these incident costs. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has
established a pollution response reserve of $10 million supported by a commercial line
of credit of $40 million to provide funding should the overall clean-up costs exceed the
liability limit of the ship owner.

Social Services
Business Services Wage Assessment Tool
The Australian Government may potentially become liable for a significant range of
costs following the Full Federal Court ruling (21 December 2012) that the use of the
Business Services Wage Assessment Tool (BSWAT) to assess the wages of
two intellectually disabled employees constituted unlawful discrimination under the
Disability Discrimination Act 1992.

The Australian Government’s potential liability cannot be quantified at this time.

National Disability Insurance Scheme
In bilateral negotiations, the Australian Government has committed to provide
temporary, untied financial assistance to some jurisdictions that expect to have their
GST entitlements adversely affected during the transition to the National Disability
Insurance Scheme (NDIS).

Under this commitment, the expected liability will depend on a range of factors
including when all jurisdictions reach full scheme and any impact resulting from the
Commonwealth Grants Commission’s 2015 Methodology Review, scheduled to be
completed in February 2015. The Review will consider the most appropriate treatment
of disability services for GST distribution purposes, both during the transition to the
NDIS and once the full scheme is operating nationally. Any impact on the Australian
Government is not expected to occur before 2016-17.

Terrorism insurance — commercial cover
The Terrorism Insurance Act 2003 established a scheme for terrorism insurance covering
damage to commercial property, including associated business interruption and public
liability. The Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) uses reinsurance
premiums paid by insurers to meet its administrative expenses and to build a fund and
purchase reinsurance to help meet future claims. The Australian Government
guarantees to pay any liabilities of the ARPC, but the Treasurer must declare a reduced
payout rate to insured entities if the Government’s liability would otherwise exceed
$10 billion.

CONTINGENT ASSETS — UNQUANTIFIABLE
Defence
Defence non-remote contingent assets
The Department of Defence has four instances of contingent assets that are
unquantifiable.

Health
Legal action seeking compensation from Sanofi
The Department of Health has initiated legal action to seek compensation from
Sanofi, the original patent owner of clopidogrel (Plavix®), for additional costs to the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) resulting from a delay in listing a generic
version of clopidogrel. Listing a generic form of clopidogrel on the Australian market
in 2008 would have triggered an automatic reduction to the price paid by the
Government for clopidogrel through the PBS and is likely to have resulted in a Price
Disclosure reduction in 2010. The first generic version of this medicine was listed in
2010 and the first Price Disclosure reduction occurred in 2012.

Legal action seeking compensation from Wyeth
The Department of Health has initiated legal action to seek compensation from
Wyeth, the original patent owner of venlafaxine (Efexor®), for additional costs to the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) resulting from a delay in listing a generic
version of venlafaxine. Listing a generic form of venlafaxine on the Australian market
in 2009 would have triggered an automatic reduction to the price paid by the
Government for venlafaxine through the PBS. The first generic version of this medicine
was listed in 2012.

Industry
Wireless Local Area Network
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has
ongoing patent infringement proceedings in the United States of America and Europe
against multiple defendants. The patents cover CSIRO’s invention of a wireless local
area network (WLAN). CSIRO expects to receive additional revenue which would
exceed the associated legal costs.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES — QUANTIFIABLE
Defence
Claims against the Department of Defence
The Department of Defence (Defence) has 28 instances of non-remote, quantifiable
contingent liabilities in respect of claims on the Department valued at $63.1 million.
The estimated figure is determined by conducting an objective analysis of the probable
amount payable for all matters managed by the members of Defence’s Legal Services
Panel and those being handled in-house by Defence Legal Division. However, as an
estimate, the exact amount payable under those claims is uncertain. Defence is
defending the claims or is trying to resolve them by recourse to alternative dispute
resolution measures.

Environment
Low Carbon Australia Limited — Board of Directors’ and senior management
indemnities
The Australian Government has provided indemnities to directors and company
officers of Low Carbon Australia Limited (LCAL). A total of seven indemnity deeds
have been executed. Each indemnity covers liability incurred by a director or officer
arising from the implementation of the merger of LCAL with the Clean Energy Finance
Corporation. An aggregate cap of $100 million to cover all claims has been established,
and the indemnities will operate for seven years from execution.

Foreign Affairs and Trade
Export Finance and Insurance Corporation
The Australian Government guarantees the due payment of money that is, or may at
any time become, payable by Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) to
anybody other than the Government. The Government also has in place a $200 million
callable capital facility available to EFIC on request to cover liabilities, losses and
claims. As at 31 March 2014, the Government’s total contingent liability was
$3.4 billion, representing an increase of $0.1 billion from that reported at the Mid-Year
Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2013-14. The $3.4 billion contingent liability comprises
EFIC’s liabilities to third parties ($2.3 billion) and EFIC’s overseas investment
insurance, contracts of insurance and guarantees ($1.0 billion). Of the total contingent
liability, $2.7 billion relates to EFIC’s Commercial Account and $0.7 billion relates to
the National Interest Account.

Social Services
Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme
The Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme (the Guarantee Scheme) guarantees the
repayment of aged care residents’ accommodation bond, entry contribution balances
and, from 1 July 2014, refundable accommodation deposits and contributions if the
approved provider becomes insolvent or bankrupt and defaults on its refund
obligations. In return for the payment, the rights that the resident had to recover the

amount from their approved provider are transferred to the Australian Government so
it can pursue the approved provider for the funds. In cases where the funds are unable
to be recovered, the Australian Government may levy all approved providers holding
bonds to meet any shortfall. On 30 June 2013, the maximum contingent liability, in the
unlikely event that all providers defaulted, was approximately $14.2 billion.

Treasury
Australian Taxation Office — tax disputes
At any point in time the Australian Taxation Office is involved in a range of dispute
resolution processes, including litigation, relating to tax disputes.

Details of the outcome of dispute resolution processes are uncertain until a court ruling
is made and/or an agreement is reached with the taxpayer. As a result, in most cases it
is not possible to estimate with any reliability the likely financial impact of current
disputes. The estimated aggregate value of tax in dispute as at 31 March 2014, for
which a provision has not been made, is $4.6 billion.

Outcomes of dispute resolution processes are included in the Commissioner of
Taxation’s Annual Report each year. This may include disputes resolved through
objections, settlements and court and tribunal decisions. It may also include amounts
owed by taxpayers that are subject to dispute but not finalised.

International financial institutions — uncalled capital subscriptions
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) since 1947. The
Government is contributing additional resources to the IBRD as part of the general
capital increase agreed in 2010. As part of this process, Australia will increase its
uncalled capital subscription so that it totals US$3.6 billion (estimated value
A$3.9 billion as at 31 March 2014).

The Australian Government has also held an uncalled capital subscription in the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) since 1991. Australia
increased its uncalled capital subscription (effective 20 April 2011) to the EBRD as part
of its 2010 general capital increase, so that it totals EUR237.5 million (estimated value
A$354.2 million as at 31 March 2014).

The Australian Government has further held an uncalled capital subscription in the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) since 1966. Australia increased its uncalled capital
subscription (effective 11 January 2010) to the ADB as part of its 2010 general capital
increase, so that it totals US$7.0 billion (estimated value A$7.6 billion as at
31 March 2014).

Australia has further held an uncalled capital subscription in the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency of US$26.5 million (estimated value A$28.7 million as at
31 March 2014).

None of these international financial institutions has ever drawn on Australia’s
uncalled capital subscriptions.

International Monetary Fund
Australia has made a line of credit available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
under its New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) since 1998. The value of Australia’s
NAB credit arrangement is Special Drawing Rights (SDR, the IMF’s unit of account)
4.4 billion (estimated value A$7.3 billion at 31 March 2014). This is a contingent loan to
help ensure that the IMF has the resources available to maintain stability and support
recovery in the global economy. As agreed by G20 Finance Ministers and IMF
Governors in late 2010, the credit arrangements of all NAB participants, including
Australia, will be reduced when a proposed increase in IMF quotas comes into effect.
The quota increase has not yet occurred, due to a delay in implementing the above
agreement by the United States.

In addition to the NAB credit line, as part of a broad international effort to increase the
resources available to the IMF, Australia has made available a SDR 4.6 billion,
(approximately A$7.7 billion at 31 March 2014) contingent bilateral loan to the IMF.
This loan entered into force following passage of enabling legislation in June 2013. The
contingent loan is on terms consistent with separate bilateral loan and note purchase
agreements to be concluded between the IMF and all contributing countries. It will be
drawn upon by the IMF only if needed to supplement the IMF’s quota and NAB
resources and any loans would be repaid in full with interest. The increase in the IMF’s
resources will help ensure that it has the capability to address any potential
vulnerability facing the global economy.

GOVERNMENT LOANS
Loans are recorded as financial assets and accordingly the amounts advanced and
repaid do not normally affect the budget aggregates of fiscal balance and underlying
cash balance. Loans that are concessional (lower than market interest rate) or are
agreed to be written off may result in an impact on fiscal balance in some
circumstances.

The Government makes loans for policy purposes. All loans contain some element of
credit risk that they will not be repaid in full, although in many cases this risk is small.

(a) The Government has decided to provide a concessional loan of up $2 billion to accelerate the delivery of the

    details are provided in Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15.
(b) The Government will provide income contingent concessional loans of $1.9 billion over four years from 2014-15
    as part of its election commitment to establish the Trade Support Loans programme. Under the programme,
    eligible apprentices will be eligible to receive financial assistance of up to $20,000 over a four year
    apprenticeship. Apprentices will be required to commence repaying the loans when their income exceeds a
    minimum repayment threshold, consistent with arrangements applying to university students under the
    Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), and apprentices who successfully complete their training will receive a

    20 percent discount on the amount to be repaid. Further information on this measure is provided in
    Budget Paper 2, Budget Measures 2014-15.
(c) Loan amount is the estimated loan programme amounts outstanding as at 30 June 2014 in $ million.
(d) From 1 June 2016, debts will be indexed by a rate equivalent to the yields on 10 year Australian Government
    bonds, capped at 6.0 percent per annum.

Higher Education Loan Program
The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is an income contingent loan programme
that assists eligible tertiary education students with the cost of their fees and overseas
study expenses. As at 30 June 2014, the fair value of loans outstanding is estimated to
be $25.2 billion. The fair value takes into account the concessionality of HELP loans
and makes an allowance for debt not expected to be repaid.

Debts are currently indexed annually by the Consumer Price Index. From 1 June 2016,
debts will be indexed by a rate equivalent to the yields on 10 year Australian
Government bonds, capped at 6 percent per annum. Further details on this decision
can be found in Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2014-15.

The repayment term depends on individual circumstances including the amount
borrowed and each debtor’s income. There were 1,823,288 HELP debtors as at
30 June 2013. The term of a HELP loan can only be determined for people who have
fully repaid their debt. As at the end of June 2013, the average duration of HELP loans
was 8.4 years.

Commonwealth-State Financing Arrangements — Housing and Specific
Purpose Capital
From 1945 to 1989, the Australian Government made concessional advances to the
State and Northern Territory Governments under Commonwealth-State financing
arrangements for housing and for specific purpose capital. The advances are
concessional fixed rate loans to be repaid over 53 years, with the last loans maturing in
2042. Annual payments, comprising both interest and principal repayment, are made
by the States and the Northern Territory. As at 30 June 2014, the estimated amortised
value of the advances is $2.1 billion.

The Australian Office of Financial Management manages the receipt of interest and
principal repayments from the State and Northern Territory Governments.

International Monetary Fund New Arrangements to Borrow
Australia has made a line of credit available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
under its new arrangements to borrow (NAB) since 1998. In line with G20 Leaders’
commitments, Australia has joined with other countries to increase its credit line under
an expanded NAB. The NAB is a contingent loan to help ensure that the IMF has the
resources available to maintain stability and support recovery in the global economy.
The funds are drawn upon by the IMF as needed to supplement the IMF’s usual quota
resources and will be repaid in full with interest. As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding
are estimated to total $950 million.

Statement 8: Statement of Risks
The value of Australia’s NAB credit arrangement is Special Drawing Rights (SDR, the
IMF’s unit of account) 4.4 billion (estimated value A$7.3 billion at 31 March 2014).

Clean Energy Finance Corporation
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has developed a portfolio of loans and
investments across the spectrum of clean energy technologies that in aggregate has an
acceptable but not excessive level of risk relative to the sector as required under the
Clean Energy Finance Corporation Investment Mandate Directions 2012 (Investment
Mandate). As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are estimated to total $865 million.

The CEFC’s portfolio consists of predominantly senior ranking, secured loans,
typically secured against assets such as buildings or council rates, or against energy
generating assets such as wind or solar farms or biogas facilities.

The Government has announced its intention to abolish the CEFC. Legislation to
abolish the CEFC and transfer the CEFC’s existing assets and liabilities to the
Commonwealth is currently before Parliament.

The CEFC has predominantly made loans as a co-financier either jointly or in
consortiums with private sector financial institutions. Interest rates vary with an
average expected return of approximately 7 percent. Loans have various maturity
dates, typically in the range of 5-10 years.

Student Financial Supplement Scheme
The Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) was a programme whereby student
income support recipients could trade one dollar of entitlement for two dollars
provided as an income contingent loan. The programme closed for new recipients on
1 January 2004. The outstanding debt relates to debtors who received loans prior to
2004. As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are estimated to total $624 million.

Indigenous Home Ownership
Indigenous Business Australia (IBA) delivers flexible loans with concessional interest
rates to improve Indigenous home ownership across Australia, including in remote
Indigenous communities. As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are estimated to total
$584 million.

Export Finance and Insurance Corporation
The loan in support of the Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas (PNG LNG)
project involves the development, construction, operation and maintenance of a LNG
liquefaction plant, gas production and processing, facilities, onshore and offshore
pipelines, associated ancillary facilities and infrastructure. As at 30 June 2014, the loan
amount outstanding is estimated to total $269 million.

The Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF), administered by the Export Finance
and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) on behalf of the former Australian Agency for
International Development (AusAID), provided concessional loans to Indonesia to

deliver development benefits to that country. The DIFF was discontinued in 1996 with
no further concessional loans being provided. As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are
estimated to total $222 million.

Indigenous Land Corporation
The Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) purchased Ayers Rock Resort for $292 million
in May 2011 and immediately on-sold it to its wholly owned subsidiary Voyages
Indigenous Tourism Australia Pty Ltd (VITA) creating an intercompany loan that is
partly funded by borrowings. The interest rate is set at the 90 day bank bill swap
reference rate plus 5 percent, and is reset six monthly. As at 30 June 2014, the loan
amount outstanding is estimated to total $291 million.

Zero Real Interest Loans
The Zero Real Interest Loans programme provided loans with a zero real interest rate
to residential aged care providers to build or expand facilities in areas of high need
where investment was otherwise unlikely. Applications for these loans are now closed.
As at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are estimated to total $230 million.

Farm Finance Concessional Loans
The Farm Finance Concessional Loans Scheme provides up to $420 million over
two years for the provision of concessional loans to eligible primary production
businesses experiencing financial difficulties resulting from acute levels of debt. Loans
will be issued for the purpose of productivity enhancements and debt refinancing. As
at 30 June 2014, loans outstanding are estimated to total $210 million.

Loans are made to State governments who, through regional delivery agents, on-lend
to primary production businesses. Currently the interest rate is at 4.5 percent, but is
reviewed on a six monthly basis and revised in accordance with material changes in
the five-year Commonwealth bond rate. Loans will be given for a term of five years,
with an exceptional circumstances clause in some jurisdictions, which allows a
maximum two year extension to the loan at commercial rates.

    STATEMENT 9: AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BUDGET
               FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter), the
Government has produced a single set of financial statements for the Australian
Government general government sector (GGS), the public non-financial
corporations (PNFC) sector and the total non-financial public sector (NFPS). The
financial statements comply with both Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) accrual
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and Australian Accounting Standards (AAS),
with departures disclosed. These statements are:

     an operating statement, including other economic flows, which shows net
•
     operating balance and net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance);

     a balance sheet, which also shows net worth, net financial worth, net financial
•
     liabilities and net debt; and

     a cash flow statement, which includes the calculation of the underlying cash
•
     balance.

In addition to these general purpose statements, notes to the financial statements are
required. These notes include a summary of accounting policies, disaggregated
information and other disclosures required by AAS.

The statements reflect the policy that ABS GFS remains the basis of budget
accounting policy, except where the Government applies AAS because it provides a
better conceptual basis for presenting information of relevance to users of public
sector financial reports.

The Australian, State and Territory governments have an agreed framework — the
Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) — for the presentation of government
financial information on a basis broadly consistent with the Australian Accounting
Standards Board standard AASB 1049. The budget financial statements are
consistent with the requirements of the UPF.

In accordance with the UPF requirements, this statement also contains an update of
the Australian Government’s Loan Council Allocation.

Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements


NOTES TO THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT SECTOR FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1: External reporting standards and accounting policies
The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) requires that the budget be based
on external reporting standards and that departures from applicable external reporting
standards be identified.

The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:

    the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) accrual Government Finance Statistics
•
    (GFS) publication, Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts,
    Sources and Methods, (cat. no. 5514.0), which in turn is based on the International
    Monetary Fund (IMF) accrual GFS framework; and

    Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), issued by the Australian Accounting
•
    Standards Board (AASB), which includes International Financial Reporting
    Standards (IFRS) as adopted in Australia and the public sector specific standard
    AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting.

The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis that complies with
both ABS GFS and AAS, except for departures disclosed at Note 2. A more detailed
description of the AAS and ABS GFS frameworks, in addition to definitions of key
terms used in these frameworks, can be found in Appendix A. Detailed accounting
policies, as well as a set of notes and other disclosures, as required by AAS, are
disclosed in the annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fiscal reporting focuses on the general government sector (GGS). The GGS provides
public services that are mainly non-market in nature and for the collective
consumption of the community, or involve the transfer or redistribution of income.
These services are largely financed through taxes and other compulsory levies, user
charging and external funding. This sector comprises all government departments,
offices and some other bodies. In preparing financial statements for the GGS, all
material transactions and balances between entities within the GGS have been
eliminated.

The Government’s key fiscal aggregates are based on ABS GFS concepts and
definitions, including the ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit and the derivation of the
underlying cash balance and net financial worth. AASB 1049 requires the disclosure of
other ABS GFS fiscal aggregates, including net operating balance, net
lending/borrowing (fiscal balance) and net worth. In addition to these ABS GFS
aggregates the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) requires disclosure of net debt,
net financial worth and net financial liabilities.




                                         9-16
                          Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

AASB 1049 and the UFP also provide a basis for reporting of the public non-financial
corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors and the total
non-financial public sector (NFPS).

AASB 1049 requires disaggregated information, by ABS GFS function, for expenses
and total assets to be disclosed where they are reliably attributable. ABS GFS does not
require total assets to be attributed to functions. In accordance with ABS GFS,
disaggregated information for expenses and net acquisition of non-financial assets by
function is disclosed in Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment. In accordance
with the UPF, purchases of non-financial assets by function are also disclosed in
Statement 6.

AASB 1049 requires major variances between original budget estimates and outcomes
to be explained in the financial statements. Explanations of variations in fiscal balance,
revenue, expenses, net capital investment, cash flows, net debt, net financial worth and
net worth since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2013-14 (MYEFO) are
disclosed in Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook, with decisions taken since the
MYEFO disclosed in Budget Paper No. 2 Budget Measures 2014. All policy decisions
taken between the 2013-14 Budget and the 2013-14 MYEFO are disclosed in Appendix
A of the MYEFO.

Details of the Australian Government’s GGS contingent liabilities are disclosed in
Statement 8: Statement of Risks.


Note 2: Departures from external reporting standards
The Charter requires that departures from applicable external reporting standards be
identified. The major differences between AAS and the ABS GFS treatments of
transactions are outlined in Table 10.

AASB 1049 requires AAS measurement of items to be disclosed on the face of the
financial statements with reconciliation to ABS GFS measurement of key fiscal
aggregates, where different, in notes to the financial statements. Differences from the
AAS measurement of items outline above and reconciliation have not been included as
they would effectively create different measures of the same aggregate.

Further information on the differences between the two systems is provided in the
ABS publication Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and
Methods, 2005 (cat. no. 5514.0).

(a) Net revenue from MRRT is expected to be $100 million in 2013-14 and zero in 2014-15 which represent the net revenue
    impact across different revenue heads. These include the offsetting reductions in company tax (through deductibility) and
    interactions with other taxes. The Government has announced the MRRT will not apply beyond 30 June 2014.
(b) Other alcoholic beverages are those not exceeding 10 percent by volume of alcohol (excluding beer, brandy and wine).
(c) Tax revenue includes carbon accrual revenue measured at legislated price, with details of the accounting treatment of
    carbon revenue set out in Note 2 to the General Government Sector Financial Statements.
(d) Capital gains tax is part of gross other individuals, company tax and superannuation fund taxes.
(e) At the 2013-14 MYEFO, the Medicare and DisabilityCare Australia levy estimates were based on when the liability to the
    levy is assessed. From the 2014-15 Budget estimates are based on when collections relating to the levy are received.
(f) This represents the net impact of the Temporary Budget Repair Levy on individuals and other withholding taxes. An
    additional $680 million is expected to be raised over the forward estimates through the temporary increase in the FBT rate
    that was announced as part of the temporary levy.

(a) For budget reporting purposes, a discount rate applied by actuaries in preparing Long-Term Cost
    Reports is used to value the superannuation liability. This reduces the volatility in reported liabilities that
    would occur from year to year if the long-term government bond rate were used. Consistent with AAS,
    the long-term government bond rate as at 30 June is used to calculate the superannuation liability for the
    purpose of actuals reporting.

The estimated and projected cash balances reflected in the balance sheet for the
Australian Government GGS (Table 2) include the reported cash balances controlled
and administered by Australian Government agencies and entities subject to the
Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and
Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act), that implement public policy through the provision of
primarily non-market services. From 1 July 2014, these agencies and entities will be
subject to equivalent provisions under the Public Governance, Performance and
Accountability Act 2013.

Revenues or monies raised by the Executive Government automatically form part of
the Consolidated Revenue Fund by force of section 81 of the Australian Constitution.
For practical purposes, total Australian Government GGS cash, less cash controlled
and administered by CAC Act entities, plus special public monies, represents the
Consolidated Revenue Fund referred to in section 81 of the Australian Constitution.
On this basis, the balance of the Consolidated Revenue Fund is shown above.

      APPENDIX A: FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AND
                               BUDGET CONCEPTS

The budget primarily focuses on the financial performance and position of the general
government sector (GGS). The ABS defines the GGS as providing public services
which are mainly non-market in nature, mainly for the collective consumption of the
community, involving the transfer or redistribution of income and financed mainly
through taxes and other compulsory levies. AASB 1049 recognises the GGS as a
reporting entity.


AASB 1049 HISTORY AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) released AASB 1049 for
application from the 2008-09 financial year. AASB 1049 seeks to ‘harmonise’ ABS GFS
and AAS.

The reporting framework for AASB 1049 requires the preparation of accrual-based
general purpose financial reports, showing government assets, liabilities, revenue,
expenses and cash flows. GGS reporting under AASB 1049 aims to provide users with
information about the stewardship of each government in relation to its GGS and
accountability for the resources entrusted to it; information about the financial
position, performance and cash flows of each government’s GGS; and information that
facilitates assessments of the macroeconomic impact. While AASB 1049 provides a
basis for whole-of-government and GGS outcome reporting (including the PNFC and
PFC sectors), budget reporting focuses on the GGS.

AASB 1049 has adopted the AAS conceptual framework and principles for the
recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and their presentation,
measurement and disclosure. In addition, AASB 1049 has broadly adopted the
ABS GFS conceptual framework for presenting government financial statements. In
particular, AASB 1049 requires the GGS to prepare a separate set of financial
statements, overriding AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
AASB 1049 also follows ABS GFS by requiring changes in net worth to be split into
either transactions or ‘other economic flows’ and for this to be presented in a single
operating statement. AASB 1049 is therefore broadly consistent with international
statistical standards and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001.1




1   Additional information on the Australian accrual GFS framework is available in the ABS
    publication Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and
    Methods, 2005 (cat. no. 5514.0).


                                           9-30
                             Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

All financial data presented in the financial statements are recorded as either stocks
(assets and liabilities) or flows (classified as either transactions or other economic
flows). Transactions result from a mutually agreed interaction between economic
entities. Despite their compulsory nature, taxes are transactions deemed to occur by
mutual agreement between the government and the taxpayer. Transactions that
increase or decrease net worth (assets less liabilities) are reported as revenues and
expenses respectively in the operating statement.2

A change to the value or volume of an asset or liability that does not result from a
transaction is an ‘other economic flow’. This can include changes in values from
market prices, most actuarial valuations, and exchange rates, and changes in volumes
from discoveries, depletion and destruction. All other economic flows are reported in
the operating statement.

Consistent with the ABS GFS framework, and in general AAS, the financial statements
record flows in the period in which they occur. As a result, prior period outcomes may
be revised for classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have
been expected to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods
and can be reliably assigned to the relevant period(s).


Operating statement
The operating statement presents details of transactions in revenues, expenses, the net
acquisition of non-financial assets (net capital investment) and other economic flows
for an accounting period.

Revenues arise from transactions that increase net worth and expenses arise from
transactions that decrease net worth. Revenues less expenses gives the net operating
balance. The net operating balance is similar to the National Accounts concept of
government saving plus capital transfers.

The net acquisition of non-financial assets (net capital investment) equals gross fixed
capital formation, less depreciation, plus changes (investment) in inventories, plus
other transactions in non-financial assets. This measures the net effect of purchases,
sales and consumption (for example, depreciation of fixed assets and use of inventory)
of non-financial assets during an accounting period.

Other economic flows are presented in the operating statement and outline changes in
net worth that are driven by economic flows other than revenues and expenses.
Revenues, expenses and other economic flows sum to the total change in net worth




2   Not all transactions impact on net worth. For example, transactions in financial assets and
    liabilities do not impact on net worth as they represent the swapping of assets and liabilities
    on the balance sheet.


                                               9-31
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

during a period. The majority of other economic flows for the Australian Government
GGS arise from price movements in its assets and liabilities.

Fiscal balance
The fiscal balance (or net lending/borrowing) is the net operating balance less net
capital investment. Thus, the fiscal balance includes the impact of net expenditure
(effectively purchases less sales) on non-financial assets rather than consumption
(depreciation) of non-financial assets.3

The fiscal balance measures the Australian Government’s investment-saving balance.
It measures in accrual terms the gap between government savings plus net capital
transfers, and investment in non-financial assets. As such, it approximates the
contribution of the Australian Government GGS to the balance on the current account
in the balance of payments.


Balance sheet
The balance sheet shows stocks of assets, liabilities and net worth. In accordance with
the UPF, net debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities are also reported in
the balance sheet.

Net worth
The net worth of the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors is defined as assets less liabilities.
This differs from the ABS GFS definition for the PNFC and PFC sectors where net
worth is defined as assets less liabilities less shares and other contributed capital. Net
worth is an economic measure of wealth, reflecting the Australian Government’s
contribution to the wealth of Australia.

Net financial worth
Net financial worth measures a government’s net holdings of financial assets. It is
calculated from the balance sheet as financial assets minus liabilities. This differs from
the ABS GFS definition of net financial worth for the PNFC and PFC sectors, defined as
financial assets, less liabilities, less shares and other contributed capital. Net financial
worth is a broader measure than net debt, in that it incorporates provisions made (such
as superannuation) as well as holdings of equity. Net financial worth includes all
classes of financial assets and all liabilities, only some of which are included in net
debt. As non-financial assets are excluded from net financial worth, this is a narrower
measure than net worth. However, it avoids the concerns inherent with the net worth
measure relating to the valuation of non-financial assets and their availability to offset
liabilities.



3   The net operating balance includes consumption of non-financial assets because depreciation
    is an expense. Depreciation also forms part of net capital investment, which (in the
    calculation of fiscal balance) offsets the inclusion of depreciation in the net operating balance.


                                                9-32
                            Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

Net financial liabilities
Net financial liabilities comprises total liabilities less financial assets but excludes
equity investments in the other sectors of the jurisdiction. Net financial liabilities is a
more accurate indicator than net debt of a jurisdiction’s fiscal position as it includes
substantial non-debt liabilities such as accrued superannuation and long service leave
entitlements. Excluding the net worth of other sectors in government results is a purer
measure of financial worth than net financial worth as, in general, the net worth of
other sectors of government, in particular the PNFC sector, is backed up by physical
assets.

Net debt
Net debt is the sum of selected financial liabilities (deposits held, government
securities, loans, and other borrowing) less the sum of selected financial assets4 (cash
and deposits, advances paid, and investments, loans and placements). This includes
financial assets held by the Future Fund which are invested in these asset classes,
including term deposits and investments in collective investment vehicles. Net debt
does not include superannuation related liabilities. Net debt is a common measure of
the strength of a government’s financial position. High levels of net debt impose a call
on future revenue flows to service that debt.

Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement identifies how cash is generated and applied in a single
accounting period. The cash flow statement reflects a cash basis of recording (rather
than an accrual basis) where information is derived indirectly from underlying accrual
transactions and movements in balances. This, in effect, means that transactions are
captured when cash is received or when cash payments are made. Cash transactions
are specifically identified because cash management is considered an integral function
of accrual budgeting.

Underlying cash balance
The underlying cash balance plus net Future Fund earnings (ABS GFS cash
surplus/deficit) is the cash counterpart of the fiscal balance, reflecting the Australian
Government’s cash investment-saving balance.




4   Financial assets are defined as cash, an equity instrument of another entity, a contractual
    right to receive cash or financial asset, and a contract that will or may be settled in the
    entity’s own equity instruments.


                                             9-33
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

For the GGS, the underlying cash balance is calculated as shown below:

       Net cash flows from operating activities
       plus
       Net cash flows from investments in non-financial assets
       less
       Net acquisitions of assets acquired under finance leases and similar
       arrangements5
       equals
       ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit
       less
       Net Future Fund earnings
       equals
       Underlying cash balance

The Government has excluded net Future Fund earnings from the calculation of the
underlying cash balance. Prior to the 2012-13 MYEFO, the underlying cash balance
only excluded the gross earnings of the Future Fund. Under the Future Fund Act 2006,
earnings are required to be reinvested to the meet the Government’s future public
sector superannuation liabilities. The Future Fund becomes available to meet the
Government’s superannuation liabilities from 2020.

In contrast, net Future Fund earnings are included in the fiscal balance because
superannuation expenses relating to future cash payments are recorded in the fiscal
balance.

Net Future Fund earnings are separately identified in the Australian Government GGS
cash flow statement in Table 3 of this statement and related tables in Statement 3: Fiscal
strategy and outlook, and Statement 10, Historical Australian Government Data.




5   The underlying cash balance treats the acquisition and disposal of non-financial assets in the
    same manner regardless of whether they occur by purchase/sale or finance lease —
    acquisitions reduce the underlying cash balance and disposals increase the underlying cash
    balance. However, finance leases do not generate cash flows at the time of acquisition or
    disposal equivalent to the value of the asset. As such, net acquisitions of assets under finance
    leases are not shown in the body of the cash flow statement but are reported as a
    supplementary item for the calculation of the underlying cash balance.


                                               9-34
                                  Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements

Headline cash balance
The headline cash balance is calculated by adding net cash flows from investments in
financial assets for policy purposes and net Future Fund earnings to the underlying
cash balance.

Cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes include equity
transactions and net advances.6 Equity transactions include equity injections into
controlled businesses and privatisations of government businesses. Net advances
include net loans to the States, net loans to students under the Higher Education Loan
Program (HELP), and contributions to international organisations that increase the
Australian Government’s financial assets.

Sectoral classifications
To assist in analysing the public sector, data is presented by institutional sector as
shown in Figure 1. ABS GFS defines the general government sector (GGS) and the
public non-financial corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC)
sectors. AASB 1049 has also adopted this sectoral reporting.

     APPENDIX B: AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL ALLOCATION
Under the Loan Council arrangements, every year the Commonwealth and each State
and Territory government nominate an annual Loan Council Allocation (LCA). A
jurisdiction’s LCA incorporates:
    the estimated non-financial public sector ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit (made up
•
    from the balance of the general government and public non-financial corporations
    sectors and total non-financial public sector acquisitions under finance leases and
    similar arrangements);
    net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes; and
•
    memorandum items, which involve transactions that are not formally borrowings
•
    but nevertheless have many of the characteristics of borrowings.
LCA nominations are considered by the Loan Council, having regard to each
jurisdiction’s fiscal position and infrastructure requirements, as well as the
macroeconomic implications of the aggregate figure.
As set out in Table B1, the Australian Government’s revised estimate for the
2014-15 LCA is a $37.4 billion deficit. This compares with its LCA nomination of a
$44.5 billion deficit endorsed by the Loan Council on 28 March 2014. The LCA Budget
estimate falls within the tolerance limit set at nomination.

    investments in financial assets for policy purposes has implications for a government’s call on financial
    markets.
(c) For the Commonwealth’s Loan Council Allocation, memorandum items include the change in net present
    value (NPV) of operating leases (with NPV greater than $5 million), the over-funding of superannuation
    and the net financing requirement of the Australian National University.
(d) A tolerance limit equal to two percent of NFPS cash receipts from operating activities applies to the

COMPARABILITY OF DATA ACROSS YEARS
The data set contains a number of structural breaks owing to accounting classification
differences and changes to the structure of the budget which cannot be eliminated
through back-casting because of data limitations. These breaks can affect the
comparability of data across years, especially when the analysis is taken over a large
number of years. Specific factors causing structural breaks include:

    from 2005-06 onwards, underlying Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data are
•
    provided by agencies in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS)
    which includes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in
    Australia. Prior to 2005-06, underlying GFS data are based on data provided by
    agencies applying AAS prior to the adoption of IFRS;



                                        10–3
Statement 10: Historical Australian Government Data

    most recent accounting classification changes that require revisions to the historical
•
    series have been back-cast (where applicable) to 1998-1999, ensuring that data are
    consistent across the accrual period from 1998-1999 onwards. However, because of
    data limitations, these changes have not been back-cast to earlier years;

    prior to 1999-2000, Australian Government general government sector debt
•
    instruments are valued at historic cost, whereas from 1999-2000 onwards they are
    valued at market prices (consistent with accrual GFS standards). This affects net
    debt and net interest payments;

    cash data up to and including 1997-98 are calculated under a cash accounting
•
    framework, while cash data from 1998-99 onwards are derived from an accrual
    accounting framework.1 Although the major methodological differences associated
    with the move to the accrual framework have been eliminated through
    back-casting, comparisons across the break may still be affected by changes to some
    data sources and collection methodologies;

    adjustments in the coverage of agencies included in the accounts of the different
•
    sectors. These include the reclassification of Central Banking Authorities from the
    general government to the public financial corporations sector in 1998-99, and
    subsequent back-casting to account for this change;

    changes in arrangements for transfer payments, where tax concessions or rebates
•
    have been replaced by payments through the social security system. This has the
    effect of increasing both cash receipts and payments, as compared with earlier
    periods, but not changing cash balances. Changes in the opposite direction (tax
    expenditures replacing payments) reduce both cash payments and receipts; and

    classification differences in the data relating to the period prior to 1976-77 (which
•
    means that earlier data may not be entirely consistent with data for 1976-77
    onwards).


REVISIONS TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED DATA
Under the accrual GFS framework and generally under AAS, flows are recorded in the
period in which they occurred. As a result, prior period outcomes may be revised for
classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have been expected
to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods, and can be
reliably assigned to the relevant period(s).




1   Prior to the 2008-09 Budget, cash data calculated under the cash accounting framework was
    used up to and including 1998-99. In the 2008-09 Budget, cash data prior to 1998-99 has been
    replaced by ABS data derived from the accrual framework.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CALL ON RESOURCES SERIES
The 2014-15 Budget introduces the call on resources series for the
Australian Government general government sector at Table 3. Call on resources
provides a measure of the aggregate level of receipts (both tax and non-tax) and
borrowings required to fund government activities. Cash data for the call on resources
series has been derived from the underlying and headline cash balance data series.


DEFLATING REAL SPENDING GROWTH BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
The 2014-15 Budget, including the historical series, calculates real spending growth
using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the deflator. Previously the non-farm GDP
deflator was used and has therefore been shown in this statement for comparative
purposes. The non-farm GDP deflator incorporates fluctuations in global commodity
prices which are not relevant in Government expenditures.

(a) From 2013-14 onwards, data for CGS on issue are projections and are rounded to the nearest $10 billion.
(b) Total CGS on issue includes CGS held on behalf of the States and the Northern Territory, but excludes
    Commonwealth holdings of CGS.
(c) The face value of CGS subject to the Treasurer’s Direction excludes the stock and securities outlined in
    subsection 51JA(2A) of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. These are the same stock and securities
    that were excluded from the previous legislative debt limit. CGS on issue subject to the Treasurer’s Direction
    are not available prior to 2008-09 because the limit was first introduced in July 2008.
(d) Interest paid consists of all cash interest payments of the general government sector, including those relating to
    CGS on issue.
(e) Estimates.
(p) Projections.
